Immigrations is under ICA, Ministry of Home Affairs. Customs is under Singapore Customs, Ministry of Finance.  Following the police force, ICA is the second largest agency in the Home Team.  The functions have been seperated in 2003 to enhance the border security by moving into Home Team.  ICA work is more than what you see as choping passport.  This is a wrong impression.  That is just one area of work and definately is the place you will work when u get your first posting as an ICA Specialist. How can 1 organisation function just by chopping passport...  Once you gain experience, there is also enforcement & investigation work, working on technology, processing paperwork, raiding, etc.  You will also get to carry firearms when selected.  Being a SGT in ICA is different from army.  SGT do not have a team of man to lead.  The rank given to you indicate you \"specialise\" in your work. Dun forget, not all documents produced by people are genuine.  You will be trained to detect forgery.  Following the ICA specialist track, you can lead a team when u reach Checkpoint Inspector (Warrant rank of army) and above.  The overall team lead is still headed by the Senior Officers.  Regimentation is currently not the culture in ICA, perhaps in future as it is still in transition phase in the Home Team.  Being so, the environment is more friendly and you can really make friends.  So as long you do what you need to do, you will definately have a great time.  If you are hardworking, you can further study private degree and convert to Senior officer.  Of cse, you need a maintain a good performance record all along.  There are lots of such examples already.  Some brief stuff abt your first posting at checkpoint..  You will perform clearance work at counters which you get to see different countries travel documents.  Do not keep thinking abt woodlands, there is other checkpoints like Tuas and Sea checkpoints for first posting. You will follow the standard procedures.  Anything you dun feel right will be referred to your superior for further followup.  After your first posting, you will have the chance to be posted to Airport for future postings.  Rotation of postings is within every few years.  Following the new wave of recuirtment, you can see that more and more pple is joining ICA to make sure officers are not overworked.  In short, the workload of ICA officers at checkpoints are quite heavy as they handled high volume of passengers daily.  But once you get used to it, you will move on.  As now is recession period, it is good to join as it is more stable and nice to give it a try.  Just remember, opinions from pple who dun work inside are not going to help much.

This is the result of their workload having ballooned in tandem with the ever-rising number of travellers who file past the land, sea and airport checkpoints to enter Singapore. Each day, 400,000 people, including Singaporeans, do so.  It does not help that about 600 ICA officers quit last year, twice as many as in 2003 - and finding replacements has been tough.  This is the picture that emerged from interviews with officers - from ICA's top brass to the rank-and-file - at Woodlands Checkpoint yesterday.  ICA Commissioner Eric Tan said the management was 'acutely aware that our officers on the ground are stretched'.  Steps have been taken, he added, to step up recruitment, augment manpower through alternative means, and use technology more widely.  The issue of over-stretched Home Team officers came up in Parliament last week, following the incident of a retiree passing through immigration controls with the wrong passport.  Of ICA's 3,800 officers, 85 per cent work in frontline positions. They screen passports, control traffic bottlenecks and perform security checks on vehicles and cargo (see box).  To critics who have complained that not all lanes at the checkpoints are opened during peak periods, an ICA spokesman said that while the agency strives to operate as many counters as it can, it has other backend operations - such as security and secondary checks - that also need hands on deck.  These demands for manpower have resulted in officers working overtime and even double shifts stretching up to 17 hours.  Corporal Frankie Chew, 28, said he has had to fill in for colleagues on medical leave, and only took two of his 14 days of annual leave last year.  He said: 'The job is not easy, too. Every day, I have to tolerate the noise, inhale exhaust fumes and keep cool even when motorists spout vulgarities. But I stay on as it is a challenge to me.'  It is no wonder he feels the strain: Last year, 143 million travellers crossed the air, land and sea checkpoints, 10 million more than in 2005.  Over that period, officer strength grew only by 200.  Checkpoint instructor Mohamed Maideen Mohamed Ismail, 38, said that years ago, two to three counters could be closed and the flow of travellers would still be cleared.  'Now, even though we open all, we still have to work overtime to clear the traffic. We really need to hire more people,' he said.  In the first five months of this year, officers at the land checkpoints clocked 15,000 to 16,000 hours of overtime a month. To maximise the number of people on duty, limits have been put on the number taking leave over long weekends.  And when an incident as major as the escape of Jemaah Islamiah detainee Mas Selamat Kastari happens, leave is frozen.  But even doing all this is not enough. Officers from other parts of the Home Team have to be marshalled.  Recruitment is not as easy as putting out an ad: Officers who are unhappy with the long work hours and sustained stress are less likely to persuade others to join the ICA.  And like the rest of the civil service, the organisation is also subject to government policies on headcount control.  The ICA bumped up its salaries in March to retain its officers, reward those who had borne extra responsibilities and attract new blood. It has also re-hired retired officers and engaged temporary staff to take on non-critical support duties.  Staff Sergeant Rino Miswari, 33, said: 'People think our job is just about stamping passports, but they don't know that our eyes are always moving, going out of the booths, checking their faces. It is tiring.'

NO JOB SECURITY; why?  - with no degree, u'll be given a 2yr contract. at the end of 2yrs, it is up to them to renew or not  - it is a job with ZERO mistake tolerance; u never scan 1 passport, u forgot to stamp ppt, u scan the wrong ppt --> ur promotion prospects are screwed  - next, it is hard not to make a mistake, imagine u are stuck in the dam counter between 10pm-3am doing the same crap, ur mind will CONFIRM switch off, unless u are superman.  2. no phones, no food/drinks, no form of entertainment in the counter. basically u can just fracking starve and die of boredom in the counter  3. if u like sitting in the same damn place for up to 6hrs, doing the same dam thing, be my guest, join ica  4. like someone said, u gana do moto counter during peak hrs, hose liao lah, u can stand on the causeway and let the lorry langgar u better  5. a lot of singaporeans damn kuai lan, unreasonable and idiotic(drive bmw, merc so what, big eff izit? no need check? pfft..). why?  -ask me stupid qs like, 'why take so long?' 'why jam?' --> inside 1 car got 10 fracking ppl, u tink can clear ppt in 1 min? stupid morons.  -ask wind down the window for check, can say ' cannot see ah?' --> stupid moron, if can see why i ask u wind down the window  -call out name, suddenly all become deaf ppl. cant even reply. moron x10  - the best phrase of the s'porean, 'i wan complain, everyday jam!' --> moronic factor x 1million. if not happy sit at home and diam diam, dun go jb.  too many bad experiences. they are never-ending. the worst experience i had was during night shift during mas slamat time. i was in the same dam counter clearing passport from . still can ask me take 30min break and open counter again. they think we robot. canina  look, whatever i said above do not relate to senior officers. i WAS a junior officer, so u can ask the fellow here who is a senior officer on the life as an SO.

ICA itself have no IPPT at the moment.  Salary is non-negotiable, Diploma with NS is gross $2076  rank wise doesn't serve anything any achievement, dip is sgt, below is corporal.  it's all uniform job.  after your 8 weeks, mostly the first 2 years attachment is at woodland checkpoint, that's where manpower need the most and people couldn't stand there.  the 1st week of training, you need to stay in, training is at home team academy near keat hong camp. take 975 from choa chu kang MRT. if not wrong, monthly pay for the 8 weeks training is $1400.  there will be fire arms handling and self defense training.  there are three shift each day and 1 day rest of the week. depend on their schedule. as ICA always shortage of ppl, you may need to cover two shift and a bit more. sometimes you may need to blow your rest day...  1 shift = 8 hours  it's a zero tolerance, zero error job, you cannot effort to miss a passport without scanned.  the job throughout your 8 hours of the day will be the same in the day.  further studies wise - you only be sponsored a related degree if you qualify for their selection (scholarship). if you want to further studies non-related, i guess you have to quit the job.  studies wise - there's no need to think part time, their schedule always very pack, you will have no time.  mainly job scope is passport-handling, searching of illegal subject or object. contraband = hand over to custom illegal person = detain them, let police handle rarely seen them do sentry work, mostly handed over to cisco security.  counter setup for checking subject is either us or Cisco gantry setup for checking vehicle is by us.  [extra] as for the searching of vehicle, there's no need to tear open a huge vehicle if there is no paper warrant to detain the vehicle from higher ups. the Senior officer (i suppose) will elevate the issue, the specs will break open the vehicle.  you either will be given permanent or contract (1 year), depend on your interview. for the contract, they can decide whether to extend or not. if not, I guess you wasted a bit.  if not wrong, there is no bonus for ICA specialist but there will be a single increment of pay at the end of the year.  for the pay wise, example Dip w/- NS, no matter how much you worked for 1 month, your pay is always $2076. this explain why ppl overworked cause ICA need to use the most of you. and this explain why some ppl there wanted to work for less cause they still be getting $2076. hard truths...  think carefully before you join, but it's good career to stay on.  ICA recruitment is monthly basis, unless it's a walk-in or career fair. the career@gov will update ICA monthly and consolidate all applicants. the things I dunno when is the start date and end date.  the usual waiting is 30 days, at least will inform you for submission of documents on the last day. between the submission and the interview is normally 1 week.  you need to take your height, weight, BMI will be auto calculated by them.  you need to convince them you can pass your non-ICT IPPT. if you haven't or didn't. they don't like IPPT failures.  if you are called for submission of documents - you need to complete a ICA application form email by them, if you didn't received, email them.  during the submission of documents, they don't really care about your professional certification (example, MCSE, CCNA, or accounting cert that kind).  they only need your fitness, highest qualification, your commitment and someone who can speak for your character references (the last one if not wrong).   sorrie I didn't arrange the above according..  I wanted to join but haven't, the above is what I know. hope me success...", "name": "ohmydog"}, {"date": "27-07-2011, 12:47 PM", "text": "Shift is 7hours not 8???

Be prepared to work shifts. (This will eventually put on weight... make you a little fatter.. and a little detrimental to your health. But there are tips and can make up for this.)  3.

For my case, all Commanders from the different ports/checkpoints.  The first question they most probably ask you is \"tell us about yourself\". Sounds simple but actually very hard coz easy to go on rambling about unimportant things, so try to make what you say is relevant to ICA.  They will ask you several other stuffs like can take shift working life, travel distances if kenna posted ulu ulu places etc etc. Its not that hard tbh and they are very nice to you, so i bet your nervousness will disappear after u walk into the room. Try to prepare like 3-4 questions coz that may show ur interest in the job. Add in more as the interview go along, confirm you will have questions after hearing more of what they have to say.  Anyways, generally try to appear interested. Dun sit too relax in the chair, when they speak to you, look at them  (in a respectful mannerlah!) and appear that you are giving them your full attention. Body posture, try to make it look like you are slightly leaning forward, shoulders straight and stay positive at whatever they say to you (they may say things like \"you live in the east? You may be posted in Tuas and not have a choice, you sure you can do it?\") Just be(or at least appear) to be confident and so sure of yourself and say something like \"Yes, I'm very sure I can cope with that, i will adjust as necessary to perform my responsibilities\"...Just wayang yaya papaya only, nothing to lose, its not like you are going to sign LoA on the same day. Later go back, you can really consider if you really want that job.  Oh yah, try to avoid words like \"ohh...\" or \"I think I should be..\" etc etc...anything that may make you appear unsure of yourself or taken by surprise. That may give them doubt or think you didn't research or not prepared for the job. Like mentioned earlier, just wayang like hell if u need to. Do whatever it takes to make them offer you.

To my knowledge, SPF allows you to, for the SO position at least, rotate between the police post/HQ/investigation during your two year bond.

I said I meant from her personal view but she turned it around and ask me what I think will be the challenges. Just smile and answer haha.

It is true that there may be a record of your past application and also the reason for your rejection. However, that can be said the same of most jobs regardless private or public. Especially when you try to apply again too soon after your previous attempt, chances are the interviewers/HR will still have some impression of past applicants.  However, it does not mean that just because you got rejected this time, you will not be selected/accepted in future. The reasons for your rejection could be due to various reasons. i.e. there might be other candidates more suitable than you at this time and if they only plan to have a 15 man course and you happen to be the 16th suitable guy. Or you are just not ready for this job based on your answers at this point of your life.  I do not know if this is your first job application or if you are currently employed/unemployed. However, I speak from personal experience that your mentality/mindset when looking for a job is greatly affected depending on your employment status. If you are unemployed and desperately want a job, then it might affect the quality of your interviews, compared to say going into an interview with a relaxed mentality that ok I will just give this a try and if it works then good, otherwise I still have my existing job. And I have been on both ends of the spectrum.  Therefore my advice for you is to perhaps try to apply for other jobs and work for a year or so or stay with your current job. If a career with ICA is what you really want, then you will naturally want to try again. And at that time, you might be better prepared and the people interviewing you may be different too.  If you are just looking to join ICA because you have no other options at the moment, then I would advise you to take longer to search for a job. Because even if they offered you a position, I can assure you that you will not last long. As some people have already commented, it is not a secret that working at ICA can be pretty demanding(i.e. shift work, demanding travellers etc). If you do not join with the right mindset, you are sure to burn out.  If you have your mind set on a career with ICA, then I look forward to you trying again soon.

Then only yesterday, I received the next charge letter. I am now required to report for the charge at the end of June. Coincidentally, the date coincides with my ICT date. The thing is, according to the CSO, when the charge dates are issued, they are fixed and not able to be changed. I called up again and the CSO told me to go back to my camp and look for the Chief Clerk or S1 to settle my charge in camp.  Can this really happen?  Now the thing I am worried about is the Chief Clerk/S1 may be busy people/do not have information regarding my charge, and therefore, may not have the time to handle my charge. If thats the case, I would be considered as defaulting the charge and may face double the penalty. Even if they are able to handle my charge, the lack of coordination may even lead to the charge not being handled properly and I may be considered as 'failure to appear'.

Then there's a sharing session by the PTIs who usually talk about how to improve your health etc. 8.30pm: Out-pro and get on with your life.  So please pass your IPPT if you can. If you did this workout by yourself outside, you'll be done in half an hour.  Needless to say once I'm done with my current RT requirement I'm going to do my darn-est best to stay out of it.", "name": "squeeish"}, {"date": "28-06-2013, 12:50 AM", "text": "Left with 1 last RT-IPPT, need a slot @Maju Camp before 22july.

Honestly? No. I did not.  My window opened and closed in September (this was before the 9 month system kicked in). In early 2012, I went to Depot Road Camp and I.O asked me why I did not go for 2010/11 IPPT and RT. I explained, he listened, and he told me he's giving me a fine ($50) and said to since we are already in the new window, please book IPPT.  Come 2011/12, I missed again. Tried to book in July, found out about the new 9 month system. Called 1800 ENS. They told me go book RT and complete within 3 months or face the music. I did that. Passed IPPT in 8th session. Then to ensure it never happens again I took the test and passed for 2012/13 window. Got a total of $200 for passing two windows.  Two weeks ago, I received the NS 264. Green letter. Charged on 27 Aug in Mowbray. Initially I was confused so I called the hotline (again. -.-) and asked. They could not clarify what the charge was for, said they'll contact unit and get back to me in 3 days.  5 days later I called again, they pulled up my case file, said unit's response was for me to go down and answer the charge. Was told there were multiple charges. I asked for which windows. The person could not find out, said he'll ask unit to contact me directly.  Never got a call, I don't want this to drag on till the last minute, so I called hotline again. Once again, same process, this time found out the charges were for 2011/12 and 2012/13. I said this cannot be true, especially for 2012/13 window. I asked if the system reflects that I cleared and the person said yes. But not sure why the unit says this is the charge. I asked for unit's direct number. Was told they don't carry it. So I found it through NS Portal.  After speaking with the person from ENC (yes, I'm an engineer), he said repeated the three charges 2011/12 IPPT, 2011/12 RT and 2012/13 IPPT) and said they had problem pulling my IPPT records to validate my claims. \"Technical issues\" was the term he used. I said, okay, I'll email screenshots from my ns portal of IPPT results and RT attendance. The guy said he'll take a look. He also gave me the direct contact for all NSmen IPPT matters for ENC. Thankfully they are helpful. This was yesterday.  This morning reply from ENC said the charges are actually 2010/11 IPPT, 2011/12 IPPT and 2011/12 RT. Sigh.  So I called the direct contact. Asked why the information is always changing. He could not really explain. Just repeated that this is what they know the charges are now. I said but I feel like the charge in Depot Road Camp in 2012 was to answer for both RT and IPPT defaults for 2010/11 window and he said no, this new charge is correct. He has a point, I guess? But the I.O back then addressed both matters.  I really don't know how I'm going to explain myself at Mowbray come 27 Aug. Will the I.O even have time to listen to this long story? How do I phrase my explanation without sounding like I'm beating around the bush?

Tips amassed from many sessions of RT and IPT! Note: I am NOT giving tips on how to train for your IPPT or what to do before your IPPT. I am giving tips for the IPPT itself. Huat Ah!  1) Standing board jump a) Wear nike air shoes (It gives you morale and extra lift) b) Do 1-2 tuck jumps before jumping c) Look forward and up. bend your knees forward and swing your arms forward when you jump. Refer to this video: d) Jump forward and jump as high as you can so that you have more 'air' time and can land further. e) when landing, turn your feet a bit and land like this  _ _ instead of landing like this: \\ /  2) Sit up a) Do as many as you can and try to get 5 points to stand a greater chance to get incentives. (I shall not elaborate much on this. Do whatever it takes to get 5 points)  3) Shuttle Run a) Start at about 2m before starting line (cheat) and start running. Reason being when you are already moving at start line, you dont have to start from 0 m/s and your timing tend to be faster. b) Take big steps and it will be preferable if you know how many steps you need. c) When you are about to turn, turn your head first. Run in straight line. Don't zig zag. d) You really only need to touch the metal plate on the other side. The one on your side, you dont really have to touch it. e) Last stretch, run like Usain Bolt. Swing your arms.  4) Chin up a) Both hands mount the bar. One leg resting on side. When no one is looking, quickly do one thro a slight jump. b) Remember its chin up, not pull up so just make sure your chin goes over and it should count. c) Second one, try to straighen fully before going. Third one onwards can keng a bit. Instructor usually give chance. d) Wriggle, swing your body to get momentum. Ahem.  5) 2.4 km run a) Choose evening timing to run as there is no glaring sun + heat. b) Choose a detail (last detail) where there's fewer runners. Less obstacles. c) Drink water and sprinkle water all over your face/body before run. d) Find someone relatively good as your pace maker. Run behind him until you gain enough energy to do the final stretch. e) Always think about the $$$ and the fact that you don't have to go for anymore RT if you pass this run.", "name": "AceyourMaths"}, {"date": "11-09-2013, 11:37 AM", "text": "i never pass my ippt or any target band before, how come my target band from 1 increase to 2....never pass 1 how to pass 2 LOL", "name": "numbers"}, {"date": "11-09-2013, 12:15 PM", "text": "Becos SAF lazy to make changes so now EVERYONE's ppt will keep increasing year after year from 1 to 4, then repeat.", "name": "AceyourMaths"}, {"date": "11-09-2013, 12:27 PM", "text": "its means after 4 yrs of IPT, you go straight to RT, no more chance", "name": "chehjin"}, {"date": "11-09-2013, 12:48 PM", "text": "IPT is to help individual to pass their IPPT in 4 years(assuming u start with 1), so no matter u pass or fail the previous year, your band will increase till it goes to 4 and remain there.", "name": "vasilli07"}, {"date": "11-09-2013, 01:48 PM", "text": "For aceyourmaths, I also have tips for ippt.  1) Standing Board Jump Jump as far as you can  2)situp Do as many as you can  3)shuttle run Run as fast as you can  4)Chinup Pull as many times as you can  5)2.4Km Run as fast as you can.

The new syllabus will be rolled out progressively from the primary to JC levels over the next three years.  With the new syllabus, MOE will also use new assessment methods from 2016. MOE said the new methods are more holistic.  To be piloted in selected schools from next year, the new assessment will provide descriptive feedback, instead of grades, in six areas.  The areas include students' participation level in PE, attainment in range of physical activities, demonstration of values and attitudes during PE lessons, performance in NAPFA and Body Mass Index, and students' self-directed physical activities with their family and friends.   #substitute NAPFA RT #substitute MOE MOD #substitute students soldiers", "name": "AceyourMaths"}, {"date": "07-11-2013, 03:51 PM", "text": "definitely not going to happen for SAF...", "name": "j_t_fusion"}, {"date": "07-11-2013, 04:53 PM", "text": "If I only completed 10 sessions for RT and get charged for defaulting RT, anyone knows whether I have to do the 20 sessions again after the charge or just the remainder 10 sessions?", "name": "mero_cwj"}, {"date": "07-11-2013, 08:03 PM", "text": "think should be just the remaining 10 sessions or just waive off if officer is good.", "name": "vasilli07"}, {"date": "07-11-2013, 11:24 PM", "text": "i nv go because of heavy rain.  sianz. i only have 1 last session of RT, which is rt-ippt. but they \"cannot\" slot me in. apparently, i have to book by myself. and the only available slot left is the 26th of nov, which is exactly the last day for me to complete my 8 sessions of RT.  if rain again on that day, GG.

Over the years, I can pass my ICT-IPPT (no gold/silver but counted for my window. Check with your unit). But this year I did not manage to clear my FFI in time, so now have to take outside.  The time difference between my birthday and ICT is 3 months, so I'm used to training myself 2, 3 times a week over 5 weeks to get up to passing rate. Now there's no short-term dateline (and the feeling that I'm not being pushed) so I'm looking at the IPT option for the first time. It seems to me 10 IPT sessions, if booked on alternate-day schedules for intensity, would not make much difference to how I train on my own, except that there are qualified PTIs and a better circuit training system (if MINDEF's advertising language is true. Also getting older oredi -> a bit difficult to train on my own).  (I also acknowledge vasilli07's advice that IPT is spread over 9 months and you must still train yourself; no guarantee that IPTs alone can help you pass IPPT. The thing is I also want to save time and be done with it asap.)  So from what I gather from earlier posts, you attend IPT-IPPT in 1st session to get a PPT banding. Then in subsequent trainings, you get colour tags to signify where you want to focus your training.  green(best, lowest intensity) yellow(cuz small group then got high chance to go gym) blue(normally 2 sets of static + run) - I prefer this red(for those really interested in passing, run run run)  Green - weight loss group yellow - pass running, fail static group blue - fail static and running red - pass static, fail running  My weakest station is SBJ. I haven't trained up yet so if I take IPPT now, will fail. Other stations I can score 3 points and above with ease (I'm a good runner). SBJ 2 points can oredi. Give me 1 month of intensive training can oredi.  My biggest questions probably lie with achieving Personal Performance Targets (PPT). I read the IPT Q&A at \"Your Role as Nsmen\" page at mindef.gov.sg. Sorry, can't post link.  From table 1, it seems to me achieving levels 1-3 is a lot easier than IPPT pass (I mean no disrespect to others, just talking about myself). Correct me if I'm wrong. So if I fail SBJ (or maybe luckily pass), and all my stations are assigned at level 1, it makes everything a lot easier? (OK, I read earlier posts said fail badly to make things easier. But I also pass last year's ICT-IPPT with SBJ 2 points so if Mindef takes last year's results for benchmark then it's PPT level 3 expected?)  And how do level 1 PPTs translate into measurable numbers? I mean, SBJ is measured in cm, right? If my standard passing length is 207cm, then PPT 1 passing length is...or is the number of squats you do? Achieving PPTs can only be known at the 2nd IPPT on the 10th IPT session, or PPTs can be achieved gradually in any IPT sessions?  Also, if the PTIs are said to be yaya papaya, that means I must take the initiative to look around and proactively make the best use of the camp facilities? I definitely need the gym to train the thighs. Which FCC camp has easiest access to gym or all the same?  I just need to know what to expect and weigh the options between IPT or train on my own again. My time arrangement is not a factor.

First time I'm seeing it here (probably it's oredi buried deep in previous posts). It should clear all my doubts.  I'm cat Z, barely passed SBJ last year at 198 cm (2 pts). If it's true that PTI will take the better result between 1st IPT-IPPT (assuming I fail SBJ now) and last year's ICT-IPPT, what is likely my banding? PPT3 or everyone starts at PPT1 in first year (that means PPT1, PPT2, PPT3 corresponds to Year1, Year2, Year3)?  I think my tip for beginning NSmen who borderline-pass IPPT is to leave IPT towards the last few years of your cycle so you don't use up all your chances. Also, the older you get, the more \"can't make it\" you feel.  After seeing that PPT table, I dun feel the pressure!  P.S.

On 1 hand, they have to handle the expectations and KPIs while on the other hand they also have to understand that NSmens are not a lifeless product but a human being and each one of us have different physical limits and constraints, whether if it's physical injuries or others.  Hence it is not my wish to share about the don'ts and what they can or cannot do to you during training. Because I am worried that by doing so will cause one of two consequences: 1) System being abused by fellow NSmens and PTIs / Certis trainers suffer, or 2) If too many abuse the system & if the information is too public, they'll just change their SOP to make it right and every NSmen suffer.  However in recent years, we have all read far too much reports of NSmen collapsing during training (Yes, even ONE death during peacetime is too much.), and while the bigger majority of PTIs and Certis trainers are good, and have our benefits at heart by training us to be physically fit for our health sake, there will always be that one rookie hotshot who is sometimes in over their head,  thinking that we're their private chimpanzee circus, or trying to push beyond the physical limits of some NSmens and appear gung-ho in front of the OCs, friends or girls (now that there're some chio bu in camp.. LOL). Remember, a lot of these PTIs / Certis trainers are very young, some as young as 22,23. And we have all been young before and we all know what some of us might have done when we were young.  Hence, I'll taper bit by bit and start with the most basic and commonly known first.  Vulgarities: This is the most basic and understood issue nowadays for army. In no way nor manner should PTIs / trainers use vulgarities on any of the NSmens, let alone those addressing mother and father. But what some might not understand is the rationale behind: The point is not just because of cultural sensitivities, respecting one another, or that we're gu-niang and cannot da-han. The point is regardless whether they're officers / PTI / trainers, once they use vulgarities onto an NSmen or trainee, they're letting people know that they're making it personal. And once they make it personal they're no longer fit to lead nor to give instructions, as whatever they say then will be determined as personal and unfair.  Medical: PTIs / trainers are not trained medical professionals, and are not fit to make any medical assessments for anyone. I've seen cases whereby some NSmens might have sprained their ankle or muscle cramp and when they raise the issue to the trainers, some trainers will ask slyly, \"you okay? still can? / medic over at the other side leh, quite far, etc \" (it's a matter of phrasing their words)  Medical attention is YOUR RIGHT, not your needs / wants. Regardless of ranks, no officers / PTIs have the right to deny any trainees / NSmen the right to medical attention once you raise the issue up. And once raised, the officer in charge / PTIs should make IMMEDIATE attempt to contact the medic to you and not take their own sweet time.  Remember, anyone can say what they want but they don't own your life. You own your own life. Sometimes, I have seen fellow NSmen raising for medical attention up to trainers but after the trainer comes over, and twist their words nicely to the NSmens (training almost over / too long never exercise, that's why, etc) , they back off and don't insist for medic anymore. You also should not be concerned whether you'll be giving the nice PTIs a hard time by asking for medic or whether they need to file written report after the training because you asked for medic. That is not your concern. Your concern should be your safety, and that your life is in your own hands. The next time you don't, just think about your loved ones, and who you promise to take care of when old. What will happen to them if you don't take good care of yourself\u2026 remember that.  Add to that, the weather and environment of now, is not like the 10/20years ago past whereby you might be able to do 50 pull ups but can only do 5 now. Remember, climate change and environment are also contributing factors and a lot has changed over the past 30years including your physical body.  I hope the above helps, but please don't abuse the system too. Should I go on?

The Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS) recommended disbursing S$2,000 extra, in Medisave grants, at each of the three \u201cmilestones\u201d an NSmen reaches, under a proposed NS HOME (Housing, Medical and Education) Awards that will replace the NSRA.  Currently, the NSRA pays S$3,000 each, when one completes NS, is at the mid-point of the Operationally-Ready NS Training Cycle, and upon completion of his NS obligations. With the exception of the first payout, which goes into an NSman\u2019s Post-Secondary Education Account, the other two disbursements are split among the Ordinary, Medisave and Special accounts.  Under the proposed new award, the existing S$3,000 at each stage will only go into the Ordinary Account, while the extra S$2,000 will go into the Medisave Account.  This is one of a raft of recommendations the CSNS has submitted for the Government\u2019s consideration on Thursday. The timeline for the various proposed changes to kick in depends on when they get accepted by the Government.  The recommendations were made after an extensive public consultation exercise lasting about a year. It engaged more than 40,000 people who are stakeholders of National Service (NS). Apart from NSmen, employers, new citizens, women and pre-enlistees were also consulted.  Providing an overview of the recommendations at a press conference, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen, the chairman of the Committee, noted: \"The benefits must never become a monetary transaction for services rendered.\"   MORE REGULARS  Separately, the committee proposed the hiring of 1,100 more regulars for the Singapore Armed Forces and 230 for the Singapore Police Force and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), with an aim to improve training and inculcate values more effectively.  Raising the proportion of officers and specialists from 30 to 40 per cent was also recommended to increase leadership opportunities for NSmen. Skills picked up by full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) could also be accredited to highlight their competencies and skills gained during NS, the CSNS said.  VOLUNTEER CORPS  The CSNS\u2019 recommendations also revealed more details of the proposed SAF Volunteer Corps. In their proposal, women, new citizens and first-generation Permanent Residents (PRs) who volunteer in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) could be given a four-week training course, followed by one to two weeks of annual commitment for a minimum of three years.  Said Minister for Social and Family Development Chan Chun Sing, who chaired the working group on support for NS: \"They are doing it because they want to... It's an added statement on the commitment of our people beyond the NS pool we have.\"  SHORTER GAP BETWEEN SCHOOL, NS  The enlistment wait-time for pre-enlistees could also be shortened to four to six months after completion of post-secondary education, said the Committee, which suggests that 90 per cent of pre-enlistees should be enlisted within four months after post-secondary studies, up from 45 per cent now. The authorities are also looking to work with tertiary institutions to reduce transition time after NS.  The Committee, comprising several ministers, top military brass, is chaired by Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen.  The recommendations \u2013 which is estimated to cost S$4.5 billion over the next decade if implemented \u2013 aim to create more opportunities for NSmen to contribute to national defence, establish a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Volunteer Corps, and strengthen recognition and benefits for NSmen.  It also strives to expand community support for servicemen, and create a positive NS experience through the easing of administrative restrictions, and strengthen the NS training system.  -TODAY/ek", "name": "AceyourMaths"}, {"date": "22-05-2014, 02:50 PM", "text": "naturally all these is just going to benefit new serviceman while the old birds which suffered the most gets nothing.", "name": "j_t_fusion"}, {"date": "22-05-2014, 10:14 PM", "text": "Song bo...I think next time 1 year ippt 1 year RT.

In this window, NSmen must complete their 20-session RT programme. They will exit the RT programme if they (1) complete 20 sessions of RT; or (2) pass IPPT .  The IPPT window has been extended from 9 months to 12 months. In this window, NSmen must attempt and pass their IPPT test. Alternatively, they can volunteer for a 10-session IPT programme.

And if you fail, RT again for 2016/2017, Plus 2016 IPPT.... etc... until the day you pass IPPT.  I'm pretty sure they will charge you if you fail to complete RT. Plus you still owe them RT and IPPT.

They will likely give you a 3/4 month period within the 12 month to complete, or as usual, you are a Defaulter.  End of story, can't escape.  WHY EXTEND THE IPPT WINDOW TO 12 MONTHS?  Under the proposed changes, an NSman\u0092s window to take and pass his IPPT is up to a full year from the current nine months, with a further 12 months to complete remedial training. The reason: Flexibility of scheduling, said MG Lim. \u0093When we give our NSmen up to 12 months to train for their IPPT and up to 12 months to complete their RT sessions, we also encourage them that they need to do it regularly. That means that you don\u0092t space out all your sessions across all 12 months, It\u0092s just that giving them 12 months will give them some flexibility. They still need to exercise regularly, at least twice a week,\u0094 said the Chief of Army.  WHAT ABOUT IPT AND RT? ANY CHANGES?  No. \"We think that some of our NSmen will still need help as we move to a three-station IPPT format, so we will retain the IPT (IPPT Preparatory Training) as well as the RT (Remedial Training) sessions and conduct them in our Fitness Conditioning Centres.

Last time, due to the 9 months window, you naturally have to wait a minimum of 3 months but now, it seems like you don't have to wait. Also, although my window is opened before the Sept 2014 implementation date, I believe I still get to enjoy 12 month window instead of the old 9 month window.   Sorry I'm not familiar with the RT system/schedule at all. I'm not bragging but I'm a comfortable silver now, what's holding me back from a gold is the running.

May 2016 to May 2017 - Under the new 12 months window, I'll just take the IPPT again on 16 May 2016 and get another Gold.  May 2017 - May 2018 - I won't have to worry until 14 May 2018 to take my IPPT.

What are the key changes under the enhanced NS IPPT Management System?  With effect from 1 Sep 2014, NSmen will be given 12 months to attempt and pass their IPPT. Alternatively, NSmen that require help can volunteer for a 10-session IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT). NSmen who pass their IPPT or complete IPT will proceed to either IPPT or IPT in their next 12-month birthday window. NSmen who fail or default IPPT or IPT will be subject to Remedial Training (RT). They will be required to complete their RT programme within their subsequent 12-month birthday windows. NSmen on IPT are advised to attend training at least once a week continuously for 10 sessions to obtain the benefits of the training regime.   What are the changes to IPPT Preparatory Training?  The IPT programme will continue to be available to NSmen who need help with IPPT training. Participants will be able to exit the programme upon meeting their PPTs. To better recognise the efforts put in by NSmen to train for IPPT, with effect from 1 Sep 14, service pay for IPT programme will be accorded to NSmen whose birthday windows start from 1 Sep 14. To motivate NSmen to participate in as many IPT sessions as they can, NSmen who default on IPT will be subjected to 20 \u2013 D sessions of RT in the next window, where D is equal to the number of IPT sessions that the NSman participated in, in the preceding 12-month birthday window.   Is there a change in determining whether NSmen have met their IPT/RT requirement?  NSmen who have failed or defaulted IPPT are liable for RT. NSmen who have defaulted IPPT will be liable for 20 sessions of RT during their 12-month RT window (new system with effect from 1 Sep 14). To differentiate between IPPT failures and defaulters, under the new system, failures will be liable to 20-D sessions (as opposed to 20 sessions), where D is equivalent to the number of IPPT/IPT attempts made in the preceding window.  They will no longer be liable for 8-sessions of RT if they do not meet their Personal Performance Targets by the 10th session.

This was done in Maju FCC.  Pushup is done in detail of 5. Each person who is doing will be watched by 1 PTI EACH. He is positioned directly in front of you. Your assistant will be to your half left. There were other extra PTIs walking around the general area who will point out to your PTI in charge of you if there are no counts. So you are watched from front and back.  1) You will take position by lying down entirely on the floor with your arms beside your chest. NO WIDE ARM.  2) You are required to do 2-3 \"demo\" pushup to your PTI. He will correct you if you do not have the proper form (body straight, arms shoulder width apart, and nothing else touching the floor when you go down) You will go back into the position in Step 1 after this. This is known as the STANDBY position.  3) PTI will say STANDBY, followed by UP. On the word UP, you will push up until your arms are straight. Assistant will put his fist below your sternum (middle of chest) which is also inbetween where your palms are. This step will take about 1-2 seconds MAX.  4) PTI says GO! You whack as many as you can in 60s. everytime your chest hits the fist your assistant will count out loud. He will continue to count as long as you hit the first. PTI will say OUT LOUD when your pushup has no count and deduct it from your final score (that your assistant counted) when you are done.  Note: they are VERY particular about form. So when you train for pushup. Focus not on numbers but on the form. make sure you do swee swee first then push for higher number. The max amount you do when training should be the max you can do without BREAKING form.  Note2: You can rest when your body is up and your hands are fully extended. You can rest with your hips pushed back (like when you kena tekkan and you holding pushup position your ass in the air like that) however BEFORE you continue the pushup you must go back to a straight body before going down to the ground.

It's the part where we have to train for it (not the time or strength part either).  Yeah sure, for pull-ups, most of us have to go exercise corners and all to train while for pushups we can just train at home. But for push-ups, how are we supposed to train for the correct form when we exercise? Since a long time ago till now, I'm sure most of us kena tekan in uniformed groups or army before but I'm dead sure none of us really cared about form back then.  The only ways I can think of to train is to get someone to watch you when you train or to put a huge-ass mirror beside yourself and stare at your own body while you do since it's damn hard to detect any \"off-form\" movements when our eyes are only located at the front of our heads.

I happened to have a large ass mirror at home so I was able to train quite easily. But yes I do see your point about it being hard to train. Also, can try training with friends or like if you have family around with you get them to correct your form. Once you familiar with the form you won't forget the feeling one. When your back not straight you should be able to feel it. Can take video to see if your back straight too. For me, I made a point to hold my breath and \"kek\" my abs area when I'm going down.  The thing is, this form IS the proper way to do the pushup, not with the back bent etc. So it is expected that you should have it and not something to be \"trained\" but sadly this is not really enforced when we trained in army so a lot of us probably have poor form now.  end of the day, like you said, LLST haha.

Make sure your legs are sufficiently wide apart, so that you can balance yourself as you land.  3. When you jump, lean your upper body forward as you're making your knees touch your chest.

I have already confirmed that part. Once you fail IPPT in a year, your next year will be an RT window instead of IPPT window.  See my remarks in blue.  2015: IPPT Window. Attend D IPPT. 2016: RT Window. Attend 20 - D RT. 2017: IPPT Window. Attend D IPPT (RT for 2016 leh? you haven't pass IPPT) 2018: RT Window. Attend 20 - D RT.  See if you do not pass IPPT in 2015. You will just do RT in 2016. After you complete RT in 2016, you do not have to do IPPT or RT for 2016 anymore.  So essentially:  2015: IPPT Window. 2016: RT Window (For 2015). Finish RT and done for the year. 2017: New IPPT Window. 2018: RT Window for 2017. Finish RT Window and done for the year.  So you see, IPPT Window only comes once every 2 years now.  I think you thought that in 2016, you have to do RT for 2015, and still do a new IPPT for 2016. That would be really painful.  So with the new system, you can do 10 IPT per year, or do IPPT + RT totalling 20 sessions over 2 years. Total is the same.  The difference is IPPT only 3 paid, all IPT/RT are paid.

Out of surprised, the PTI says that i did not do my FFI. I called my unit yesterday and they also say the system didnt reflect my ffi though they know i did it back in May. Over the phone, my unit nsf clerk insisted that my ffi was only valid for 4 mths which had expired in Sep, which IMO is total bs. After much \"discussion\" over the phone, i demanded that they must formally send me a saf100 for another ffi, else it will be hard for my to explain to my employer why i need to do multiple ffi. They schedule the ffi on the late Oct.  Ok, my situation is that i have a 2 weeks HK next week. So can i still do my ippt during this ict without the ffi?

But I've got a few questions. Here's a brief introduction: Enlisted for SPF on APR 2016, PES A, IPPT pass (silver), A level graduate (soon-to-be), passion for SPF I'd say 60-70%.  Now I understand that if I no passion don't look for a career in SPF but thing is, I no money (for real). To give you guys a sense of how much money I DON'T have: family of 8, only 1 income earner (my dad) who works as a bus driver.  Hence with that said, I think government service quite stable + not bad pay leh. I heard if sign on SPF they will slap $30G across your face and got a lot of other benefits like class 3 driving license. (For A level holders)  Plus I thinking of trying for the scholarship, cos based on my understanding, scholars way btr than normal sign on. I know it is painstakingly difficult to go through the process, plus very hard to get in. But can I get a sense of how hard to get in? Let's just be optimistic and say I got AAA/C and pass in GP (quite realistic). And if you can't infer... I am NOT from elite JC.

Inside the room is the 3 interviewer sitting behind the table, then you are sitting quite a distance from them, so they can actually see u from head to toe thru out the interview...  so the guy ask me,\" so why you want to enter the police force?\" den i just say its a meaningful job blah blah blah, and den ask me if i intend to further study if i enter the force, how long do i intend to join them, do i know anybody who is in the police force, do i know what are the shift work, do i know where i will be training if i got selected.. I manage to ans their ques, actually there are more things i want to say that i had prepared b4 but because inside really quite stress, so i only manage to tell them abt 60%-70% of my thought, only realised that after i leave the room, quite sad.. so guys going for the interview make sure you had prepared well on how to ans their ques.. After the interview, i am free to go..

Once they get u to the medical checkup, i think about 95% u r selected. Medical test is one exam you cannot fail, unless u noe have a underlying medical condition.  Once u get in, you will have a bond signing ceremony @ HTA. I am not sure who to get because I go in halfway during Police NS so i do not need to serve a bond. After the bond signing, 6 mths stay in training. After the training, if you pass you get posted. Thats when the sai kang stuff starts.  No completion of contract bonus unlike army. But there is a 6 year bonus about S$2000 if i m not wrong. Every 5 years in the police force u will get a long service badge, the longer your service, the longer it is. What we would call a color TV.  Every year will get increment. Every march will have performance bonus, depending on your performance grade. Generally, 1st year don expect too much. D or C is good enough. Unless you angkat your TL balls you will usually get D. After the 2nd or 3rd year your PB will be slightly more. July and Dec will get bonus as well.

You must first understand the general role of a police officer then approach by highlighting your strength in handling your duties. What faculty did you graduate from or past work experience?  And if you are answering the questions during interview, always focus on the interviewers and maintain eye contact. Avoiding eye contact is a cue of guilt, lacking confidence, power and authority. It is something that police officer should have at their disposal. Apply it tactfully as too much of eye contact may be perceive as hostility. To overcome it, shift your eye contact from one interviewer to another. It displays leadership in bringing everyone you are addressing into the picture or conversation. Action speaks louder than words and so I display it during the interview.  It takes lots of training to achieve this so try to apply this technique on your friends during a mock interview. I came from a sales line so I'm used to talking to people and that is one of the ways I relate past experiences and interpersonal skills into the duties of a police officer.

Put it this way, if the candidate was not shortlisted due to unable to meet to the minimum prerequisite, have a criminal or any other disciplinary/medical records etc, well no amount of applications made any difference.

So probably hmmm, there are better pool of applicants to choose from during that period. I hope you get what I mean.  Secondly, if candidate application was rejected due to the interviews, than they are most welcome to try again. There are no maximum no of attempts. There are officers who got the job on their 6th-8th attempts. Although luck do play apart here, which interviewer they were assigned to (some are more lenient than the others) its still falls back on the candidate attitude and mindset.  The best way to pass thru the interview is being yourself. If you were to be rejected (unsuitable for the position) due to your character or personality then let it be. Its kind of blessing in disguise.

This is about my experience (and eventual rejection) of my application as a Junior Police Officer.   : Applied for the post.   : Sent email to police recruitment email, asking about my status of application.   : Immediate reply in the morning, stating that \"We are processing your application and will be notified soon.\"   : SMS & Email received in the morning, stating that I had to go to the Old Police Academy on the  for an interview and various tests on the 21st of May.   : Psychometric test, followed by lunch at the canteen, followed by filling up of documents (really redundant documents), followed by a English Proficiency test, basically a written composition, topic is random.  This was followed by selecting what division you are interested in (4 choices given by the Police, pick 1), followed by stripping in a room with every other male, body check, body function check.  Everyone was then asked to put on clothes and leave the room.  This was where I failed. I am extremely certain my body functions all passed, but my probable rejection is because my body is covered in scars (keloids).  I was called back in to the room, asked a few questions, then asked to leave first.   So my advice to you, future regular policemen, is to ensure that...  1) Your family background is absolutely clean. 2) Your skin is clean e.g. no massive amounts of scars. 3) Your handwriting is neat. 4) Don't let the negative posts take you down, persevere if you really feel you want to be a policeman.

Those who are shy about stripping do not worry because everybody will face the wall) 9)Verification of documents, DO BRING EVERYTHING that u are asked to. 10)Interview by 3 panels. Usual questions asked are, tell me about yourself and y do u want to join the SPF. For me, they also asked me what does SPF do and how they do it (kind of technical). Do some homework by reading their website. They will also probe into those things that u declared. (E.G casino self exlusion, past injuries, tattoos etc)  Total interview duration is about 15mins.  Additional info is, inside the interview room, u are seated about 1meter away from their table so it might be a bit of stressful.

Baby plans etc.  I heard especially IO tour is keep clearing cases and shift is also like junior PO?  say next year late wedding, training will disrupt my plans if unless I enter in August intake...  What if one day I wanna leave the force due to commitment to family, low progression and promotion, will I regret one day that my experience is irrelevant to outside world... So many worries..

End of the day, it is a matter of priorities, which is more important to you? Your family (and wife-to-be), your aspirations to be a police officer, or are they both equally important? But this is not a MCQ question, you can choose either one or you can choose both, it depends on how you manage yourself and your time.  As far as I know, jobs like a SPO with SPF are very heavy on commitment and they will expect nothing less from you. What to do, the security of Singapore has to be in capable, committed hands. So family support is very important, especially from your immediate family.  Find out why exactly your gf don't support you, if she is afraid that time away will strain your relationship, then the onus is upon you to ensure her otherwise. If she is concerned about safety (like my family), the last reported death in the line of duty due to felonious attacks is in the 1970s, nowadays the deaths are mostly due to traffic accidents.

Since its a holiday, and i am kinda free, let me share my thoughts for Jeffrey Tan. (during my time with him, he was LTA) And Please Please Please pardon me for my English. Didnt really study hard back then.  I was in the 07 batch so its quite way back but he did left a good memories to me.  Before my enlistment to BMT, all my friends were telling me that pray hard dont heng heng go in to Ninja Company. The most xiong company in BMTC. After getting the slip when waiting to swear in, i saw the slip and it wrote \"N\" Coy. Since its a done deal, i was like, \"okay, its only for 3 months.\"  There are many bits and pieces of memories of him during my BMT times. Just let me share a few of my past experience with him as the OC of Ninja Coy.   It was being paste outside of the COY office, \"DONT DRAG YOUR BOOTS\", initially we didnt understand why he emphasis on dont drag your boots. he only told us during field camp. If a soldier drag his boots in the field(forest), there bound to have branches and leaves thus creating a huge commotion even before you spot the person(he did told one of the instructor to demo to us). It was indeed true, so much so about tactical during mission. If you drag your boots in the jungle, the enemy will know you are coming. Make Sense?  I am not sure about what you guys think but whenever i see a person dragging his foot wear, i got very irritated, not only the person is portraying that he is sloppy and its kind of noisy also. So i think, when someone wants to show he unhappiness or laziness, he will tend to drag his foot wear.  Its true that whenever he caught anyone dragging boots in road march, we will get the legendary U turn. But it was not that far when we U turn all the way back to Company and start over again.  I read some of the comments from other forumer, and i notice one saying that \"ask him to carry field pack to watch 20km or something like that\" Well, to answer that, he did carry his FBO, and additional Field Pack of fellow mates fall out. And always he is with the front recee wearing \"troops marching\" guys. Our target for road march was 4km 40mins. so everytime is was more than marching, its like fast march that kind.  About his injury, i am not sure should we share this, but he was injured during some exercise.  Some of his favorite quotes   I remember there was once other recruits tag along with us for the IPPT(they failed in their company so have to retake), when the conducting officer is giving the briefing, and the another company guys, was looking down(not paying attention), Tan suddenly shout, \"you look at your c**K for f**k?\" the whole company knock it down because of him. The best thing was, he walk to the recruit when asking \"understand?understand?understand? and he didnt hear any \"yes sir,yes sir,yes sir\". Next moment, Tan ask the recruit to recover, and asked him why never shout? the next moment, Tan ask the recruit to run to a fire hydrant about 30 metres away and shout 100 times \"YES SIR\". In my mind, ya, we were so used to his style, so that recruit was just sway to the max.  After which, he explained, everything being conducted in SAF has it own reason, including the repeated safety briefing which we have heard thousands times during BMT. Who to blame? Tan? or the Recruit? Tan is doing his job to ensure that everyone is clear to the instructions given. The recruit is the first time attached to our Coy.    I am not sure whats the exercise call, but its spamming of rounds in the sky when there is a fighter jet fly pass. We didnt do it though because he thought its lame, because the jet is flying so high in the sky and fast. With only effective range of 400m(M16), he felt that its not rational to disclose our location and it will do any damage to it. Its sound so logical to me.  I remembered when one was caught didnt apply his camo properly, we have to do many many many times of camo on camo off. why i remember was because, i was getting ready for the next camo on, instead, it was knock it down. #$%^&*&@%#. it was a funny moment.    whenever we go to cookhouse, while queuing for food, people tend to ask which COY are you from, and after telling mine, they were like \"wow, half commando\" a sense of pride from the COY suddenly ignite within me. haha.    Days before POP, i was hoping that he will be the one that lead us in the marching, at least parents and friends will know that we are trained by a commando, but instead, he was the Parade Commander of our POP thus only Coy 2ic lead us. Its kinda sad for me cause after being tekan from him for so long, he was not able to lead us in the march.  Before our POP, he took time to come and speak with us, he say, \"well, i am sorry that i cant lead you all in the parade, as i need to be the parade commander, but i hope you guys will take what you have learnt in BMT and applied it in remaining years in NS\" and he did the magical thing, SMILE. for the entire BMT, didnt see him smile before. well, that was the last time i saw him.  So, my thoughts for him is like love and hate, i always tell people that NS was a turning point of my life, It makes me a better man and a better soldier(i know it sounds wayang but i still have to say it). Of course his training was tough, but tough time dont last, but tough man do.  To Jeffrey Tan,  Sir, if you are reading this, i hope you are doing well in your life. I do missed you sometimes of your repeated \"understand\" and mickey mouse and the occasionally f**k off.

Gen 2 - cut-cost composition of the sole. dunno what stupid grade rubber they used. upper sole and lower sole were of different flexibility, thus as one flexes the other restricts causing pre-mature crocodile of the boots. but do note the type of crocodile the boots have. type 1 is is mentioned above, the sole itself split into 2 halves length-wise. meaning the top half is still glued to the boot when the lower half opens up and dangle. type 2 happens when the upper [older rubber composition] and newer rubber composition are glued securely and the older rubber disintegrate as expected of all latex based products.... you'll know when  you \"stomp\" your boots and bit and pieces fall out and it breaks off like powder when you pick them up....  the full leather boot also went thru 2 revisions..... the mismatch of rubber soles composition and the gen 2 goretex sole.  a 3rd revision saw the sole to be fully composed of the newer rubber.

Well the ratio of malays to chinese or any other race is not that great actually. There are a lot of people with lower education though, hence not mentally strong enough to hold a gun I perceive? I am not sure of that myself.  Race doesn't play a part in Singapore man. Even if you go out and work in the future, can you ensure all your colleagues are of your race? Racial equality my friend.  Alpha company in CD is tougher compared to other COY because of the strong sense of discipline that the Instructors place on the recruits. I know because I was an Instructor from Alpha COY. I admit we push the recruits hard but of course there are times to relax and we are not sadistic or anything. It is that we demand high respect and satisfaction from our work. But that was when I was there. I am not very sure of how life is in SCDF BRTC now.  DART is not a vocation. DART is the elite force in SCDF that you can join only as a regular. It is not easy. And for those who thought of signing on for the SAF but \"suay suay\" kena SCDF and now thinking of whether to sign on or not, first ask yourself, why do you want to sign on? Because you are afraid that you can't get a decent job outside? Then you are escaping reality. Signing on to any force is a lifetime commitment. Ask yourself what you really want and where do you see yourself 5, 10 or even 20 years down the road. Can you actually handle this?  Do not make a hasty decision and regret when you get older. Do not sign on if you don't even have plans for yourself, if not you're just wasting your time and you won't go far. I hope i'm not being a preacher here and well National Service is not a waste of time. Those who think it is a waste fo time, then why didn't you think of something to do? Or excel since you are already there. Think about what you can do for yourself and not waste your 2 years there. Thank you.", "name": "HiByeFriend"}, {"date": "09-05-2007, 05:48 PM", "text": "Wow!

In NS there's always a saying, you can do whatever you want, but don't get caught.  Me and my old timer instructor colleagues have caught so many recruits smoking before and most of the time we throw them into DB straight. Yes it is legal to do that. Just be a good boy, do well and earn your nights off.  For chiongers, go for ERS course if you have 5 O's and above. Good for you. If deployed in stations, can hit ard 1k. For those lower education fight for fire fighter course, good money also. There are a lot of other vocations as well you will know after you enlist. Maybe cut your hair before enlistment itself because the barber really sucks. Try not to bootlick ppl cause it is damn obvious and instructors plus your fellow recruits surely condemn you.

Usu. no problem.  2) Yes it is recognized.  3)Not necessary. I have ERS with degree. Basc=ically after you get your degree, you still need to go for interviews at Manpower and if go through, then you will go for 9 mths BOC. Then you will get rank base on your degree. If interview doesn't get through, I don't know whether you will be considered again in future.  4) I don't think you can finish a degree in less than 2 yrs right? So if at the end of ERS, you can 1) choose to sign on while contuning your degree with a 2 yrs bond, or 2) go outside work and do your degree.

Same for officier cadets and ers)  -yes.. just say yes yes yes to everything.... basically the selection criteria is base on your education.. at least a dip.. next is base on your medical records.. pes A or B is the same to them.. next is your eyesight... there is a round of interview conducted during your ptp by your sergent or cpl to ask what's ur preference(ers/medic/ff/driver or store) just state what you want.. but there's cases where pple put all 3 choices of something else but still get selected for ers.. because it's just a preference..sometime/most of the time it does not play a part in their posting decision.. it's your education level that decides most things.  you may have a 2nd interview when you are send to cda for ers briefing. usually this is done to reduce the number of pple selected. u should know what to say.    All the info above is for ptp batch.. direct (fit squard) to brt is another story. basically you dun have interview(the most is the 2nd interview i mention above). within the first week of your brt phase you will be notified and send to cda for ers or ff training if you are selected.   >I believe the ERS course is 6 months duration, during this 6 months, how's the allowance and rank like? Will you be just Trainee throughout the 6 months course?  recruit pay. 6 months.. there's junior and senior ers.. the mark is 3 months. before is junior.. after is senior.. the trainee rank is shown by an upside down arrow or two(senior). yes..as trainee throughout... you will be attached to firestation for 2 weekends nearing the end.  well.. enjoy your 7 days OBS if u get selected. u get to run all over pula ubin(it's true) and kayak at least twice around pula ubin(1 round will take roughly 12 hours or longer)   >After passing out from ERS, I believe you will be posted to a station, from that point, what's your rank and allowance like?  depends.. regular will be posted to station first... left over vacancy will be for the better performing nsf. the rest will either go srb(stay-in) or as instructor for brtc.  sergent basic pay is $700. beside that for frontline pple(station personel& SRB) you will receive another $300 if you pass your hrct and ippt test(taken every 6 months). meal is not provided for station personel so meal allownace is given. $12 per duty.. which will be roughly $120 per month.. u will get around 1.1k per month after some welfare $$ deduction  there's an addition one time $200 if you pass some basic  rescue proficiency test. the test is carry out once every year.  ippt gold and silver is the same as army. gold $200, silver $100  >Any advice for us, the new recruits tomorrow?

I am confirmed for my NUS studies during June 2009 and i will be enlisted into SCDF during April 2008.  With only 1 year of service in SCDF from April 2008 to June 2009, am i still eligible for early disruption for my studies or is a 1 year period too short for an early disruption?  Actually i could have enlisted earlier but according to CMPB, it was due to my medical problem that delayed my enlistment to next year.  I really couldn't find any disruption information in NS.SG except for (Extension/Resume of disruption) and (SPF eDisruption). This 2 doesn't have the info i want to know so i hope some of you guys can help me with this. I've heard some (older NSMen during the 2.5 years service time) said that need to serve at least 2 years then can disrupt, but for the current 2 year service, how will it be?

So far, i nv kanna OT b4, Late calls... If u are a station medic u will sure kanna a few times one... cannot run away from this one. Complain is Complain, must learn n dont act like a small kid n say \"Y that station can, our station cannot?\" cos u will mostly get f**cked. And u can try this on yr 1st day of posting to piss everyone off by asking \"what time is Lunch time\" ^^ AND 1 more thing, IF SM ask u to do something, sometimes its to help u get use to it so when u run alone u will not be a kuku, dont treat everything so negatively. Not sure ask, if u think the SM is bullying u, ask or tell the PM. Cos i have seen Idiots saying SM bullying junior, and when PM ask junior stuff, and he dunno... SM kanna scolding cossss 'SM nv Teach Junior'. ^^ _|_   Break that cycle? what u mean, wanna act punk after u pass out? PLZ dont try that. Maybe the intructors are doing that to toughen u guys up when u post out? so u will not B*tch at everything ppl ask u to do? MAYBE? Just think positive.

Just to clarify. As an NSF, you don't become a paramedic. You become a medic. The ambulance crew consists of 3 people. 1 Driver, 1 paramedic, 1 medic. The medics job is to basically aid the PM in cases. For example, the PM needs you to bandage a wound, you do so. He needs you to prepare IV drip, you do so. Whats wrong with the patient, what he's suffering from, how to treat him, the PM decides. You just do what the PM wants. Besides that, your main job scope is to ensure the ambulance is stocked up on medical supplies, keep it clean, and depending on your PM, there might be paperwork.  Fire fighters and Medics get a basic pay of $420 (after the pay revision by GOVT this year) for privates. There's Skill allowance to get if you pass your IPPT and your theory tests both held every six months. Medics get $100, firefighters get $300. There might be meal allowance depending where you are posted at.  To be honest, medics seem underpaid. The pay does not justify the amount of job you do.

For BRT stage , swimming is once a week. The first lesson will be a Cat test to see who are the swimmers / non swimmers. There isnt enough time to even teach you how to swim if you are just going for Brt.  With regards to locks , highly recommend bring key + lock . Most people like to hide their keys under pillows or on top of lockers which are forbidden. Your sirs may carry out what is known as a \"tsunami\" where they open up and mess your bunk when you are out doing lessons . We kena once to find beds overturned and peoples handphone and wallets missing . Reason being the sirs found your key.  There is a safe way to hide it however . You have a pair of boots and a pair of running shoes . Put the keys under the sole of whatever pair you are currently not using .  Just remember to STANDARDISE your stuff in the bunk. Even minor stuff like hanging of shirts in different directions can cause you to drop 20. If one persons shoes are outside , the rest must be outside. For cleaning bunks , REMEMBER to clean the top of the door and the electric box in your bunk. Those are the 2 places most people miss and the instructors love to check these 2 areas.  Remember not to bring cigarettes , lighters and chargers. Smoking is strictly forbidden in SCDF. This is not Tekong where you are allowed a few sticks a day . They will emphasise this again and again . If you have them when book in , just surrender to your instructors. They will return it to you at the end of the week.  I do not know for other companies but for mine , 5BX is at 5.10 so waking up at 4.45 is a good idea.

But don't know how the bunks and stuff work.  My friend also has a back problem, but he ended up with a PES A also because his problem hasn't acted up in the past year.  The Sergeant course you're referring to is the Section Commander Course, also known as Emergency Rescue Specialist Course or Fire Rescue Specialist in the past. If you express an interest (sometimes not even, apparently) and your eyesight degrees is less than 500 on each side with no colour blindness history, you will most probably be selected for SCC.  SCC is a 6 month course with 2 terms. The first is for firefighting, and the second is for command and control, since you'll be in charge of a group of firemen after you pass out. Each term is 3 months and most of the firefighting term will be focused on physical training. Out of all the SCDF vocations, I understand that the course for Firefighters and Section Commanders are the toughest.  From what I gather, BRT (which is what we're enlisting into) does not involve a lot of physical training, at least not as much as those who enlisted in June into PTP (i.e those who failed NAPFA). In that 2 weeks, I think it'd be up to you (...us. ) to train up. SCC will be tough enough that your fitness will go up quickly.  After liaising with an SCDF civilian staff, I understand that nobody who went through SCC got less than a silver for IPPT at the end; silver is the minimum required to pass out as a Section Commander.  If you really cannot take the training, you can Out of Course (OOC), but I'm not sure how to go about that. has a discussion on how to OOC  If you OOC, I think you will be sent back to NSTI. has a discussion on what happens after OOC.  However, if you can stay through the 6 months and pass out, Section Commanders command one of the highest (if not the highest) allowances in NS at $1.1k a month. You will work 24 hour shifts and rest for 2 days, but I understand that rest days can and will be burned for courses. The number of fire calls is also lesser than the amount of ambulance calls (which is what you will be attending to if you pass out as a Medic Orderly).  Just stay through la.

You need to remember that key lock may cause you to lock yourself out (happened to me), so if you want a key lock, be prepared to bring an extra in case you have to cut the lock (the cutter can be found in the instructor's dormitory on the third floor of NSTI; contact your instructors before you go in and take first obviously).  I don't think you need nail clippers. Unless your nails grow very fast, even getting confined for one weekend should be fine.  Get yourself a portable charger, unless you are using an old phone with good battery. Socket chargers are definitely not allowed (even the regulars' socket chargers were confiscated on our first book in though they were brought in without problem on the first week). I understand that CDA allows socket chargers, but even then I don't think it's a good idea. It's just easier to have your phone with you as you sms or call your family/friends/significant other.  1) No confinement . Only those in BRT got confinement. I lucked out because I was with the regulars, so I didn't have to go confinement. Probably will get confined one of these weeks in CDA though.  2) Camera phones definitely allowed, but don't take pictures. If you want to take, never ever ever ever ever post anywhere. If they find out you will kena charged.  Word of advice since you're going to be enlisting soon. Do not worry about enlisting into SCDF. NSTI is a really nice place. The instructors, Sergeants and officers are really nice. You may think that they're monsters at first, but they all are actually really nice when nothing serious is going on. The regimentation is actually really manageable, and they will make sure you know the things you need to know not to get into trouble. How to march, footdrill commands, etc.  You will definitely get homesick, and there's nothing I can say to relieve this feeling, but make sure you call your family every night before you sleep. It really helps with the feeling of hopelessness. You can even video call them if you want. You will definitely get emotional because you will miss your family. Just go to a private place (or in your bed after lights out) and let it all out because it helps. They also have a counselling hotline you can call if you're really depressed. Most importantly, talk to your platoon mates because they will definitely feel the same way, especially since everyone in your platoon will be NSFs and this will be the first time.  Since you're enlisting into PTP, be prepared to just be doing exercises everyday. My friend from the same section said he was really demoralized everyday because their routine was exercise in the morning -> breakfast -> bunk inspection -> more exercises, etc. Train up a bit before you enlist because you have time. Don't worry about IPPT for the time being. If you want to go through smoothly, make sure you can do a lot of pushups and things like burpees (squat thrusts). Try to do these exercises until you have to rest your body on the floor before every pushup, and until your legs just cannot move when you squat down for burpees.   I think there were some doing RT at the NSTI parade square. Not sure where they fall in though.", "name": "triface"}, {"date": "21-08-2013, 06:13 PM", "text": "Fat ppl who can't do a single push up how ah?

When are you enlisting again? I know you mentioned it somewhere in the last few pages but I can't find it. Just try and do some dieting before you go in. The lesser weight will help make it easier. There's enough things to worry about like the regimentation and adaptation. Might as well make it easier.  Edit: In a way, it's better if you're going in as PTP.

Possible reason you don't get to become a spec if you meet the above criteria is because too many regular trainees in your intake. so even if you got diploma, too bad no available slot for you, so off you go to FFC. SCC is 6 months course btw.  If you emerge in the top 10%of SCC, got chance to go to RCC officer course for the last 3 months then you pass out as LTA. Take note, SCDF nsf officers are mostly seconded from SAF. So if you posted to SCDF directly and aim to become officer, this is your only route.  FFC will take in the remaining combat fit leftovers, normally ITE grads or O levels, to be man. If I remember correctly, you will pass out as LCP so you can enjoy the rank allowance. Station hard to get promoted so that's why they promote you upon POP, it wasn't like that in the past. FFC is 3 months course.

Enjoy your time in SCDF, especially those who end up in stations. It's a shitty and thankless job, but SCDF prepares you for life better than other organizations. You work with people coming from all walks of life (arguably even more than army; let's not talk about police. It's not a coincidence their guys are always the same pattern), so you need to know how to manage yourself and others. You also learn to tahan stupid, crazy and people who simply can't do **** (although that can be argued to be the case for all).   Have to agree SCC is a very different ball game compared to general cardio fitness. Strength helps a lot, but without good BA endurance, even a hulk will be reduced to being useless.  In all honesty, the course prepares you for nothing other than BA endurance and some basic knowledge of firefighting. It is a custom for station personnel to give newly posted-in guys 3 months to learn their equipment. If they prove they can do things fast and effectively, they gain their respect. Otherwise, be prepared to feel like new boy for as long as it takes you to be on par with the rest of the guys.   I agree with you that it's very disheartening when someone who is supposed to command you doesn't know what he's doing, but I'd just like to point out that there's a way less margin of error that sect comms face compared to firefighters. I think we need to keep that in mind. That's why I'm more forgiving of the newer sect comms who come in as compared to the firefighters.

With the new fire station about to go operational soon, I expect the shortage to become worse.  To those who're asking about PTP/BRT, from my understanding, there usually isn't much typecasting that happens at that point, in the sense that we can't confidently say all drivers will come from BRT batch, or the fit guys who have trained for 2 months extra will all cross over to CDA. True to the rojak nature of SCDF, wherever you go, you will have people coming from different intake, company, etc.  For the new guys who are thinking of what vocations they want to express interest in, to reiterate previous discussions on how CDA is much worse than NSTI... It's not la. At least not as horrible as many think it is. Does the training suck? Yes it sucks. But the NSTI training sucks also.  If you want to do something meaningful and contribute to the country during your NS period, aim to cross over. Doesn't matter if you end up being a firefighter or section commander. Definitely beats being stuck in an admin role. You will hate the training for as long as you're there. Then when you enter station, you will hate the station because every duty means more opportunities for people to test you. But once you settle down and can do whatever needs to be done proficiently, life will be so good and you will have so many days at home during your NS period. I know a person whose uncle asked him, \"Your this one NS meh? Why every day I see you at home one?\"  If you know for sure you cannot be assed to do anything, feel free to go ahead and keng to PES C and below, be in an admin role then ORD and go further your studies. But I think you are missing out on an opportunity that not many get, which is to actually save lives and fight fires.  I hate the job because it's not what I like to do, but I'm proud as hell to be able to call myself a firefighter.   Everywhere also not enough manpower la... Home Team as a whole quite underfunded.

I've seen so many times people regret signing on because it is totally not what they imagine it to be.  I must add however that this is the opposite for the medical side.

There is no such thing as Cannot only I don't want to.  3) Drink plenty of water daily (Before bed and during morning)  4) During free time, try to do running, push up or weight training through carrying 64mm hoses (Around 20kg)  5) Don't think about time, will go very fast de. For me, Monday is the only shag day, Tuesday is the second day already you past the previous worst day, Wednesday is mid week, weekend coming + Ice cream, Thursday, tml is book out day, Friday (Usually only half day of training then clean dorm) Book out lo!  6) Weekends can do some light exercise but please don't go drinking on Sunday or you gonna have it bad.  7) At night remember to sleep well, express your stress on your friends and family to keep a healthy mindset.  Lastly, perseverance is the most important point to pass your time in CDA. Been there, done that, although its not easy but i made it through. Proud to be wearing the fire badge and bunker gear and most of all, from a scrawny 50kg boy who cannot even lift a single 64mm hose to a 60kg man carrying 3x 64mm hose (Please don't try this in CDA) running up the hose tower. I heard that CDA now very relax compared to my time. They will slowly teach you the basics then start slow from hose carrying to donning of bunker gear then BA set, unlike my time, first week everything throw at you and expect you to be able to do it le.  Anyway, Good luck to those crossing over and anything if you need help, Sound off to your DI, enciks or share with your friends. There is also a SCDF anonymous helpline can be found from the website to share your woes.

Don't bother controlling your breathing in your first few BA sessions.

First of all, the HOME award is not a bad sponsorship at all. Helps you save a lot of money in the long run, especially if you haven't completed your NS (because you'll be drawing regular pay for your entire NS period). Results are not everything (really, trust me on this. Don't ask how I know), but they help. What's important is you ace the interview. The number of applicants is not little (don't have the current numbers, but I understand about 200-300+ applications were received in 2010), so you still need to differentiate yourself from the other candidates.  As a section commander, these are the things you do: - Go through the training like everybody else, both as a trainee and when you're posted to your station (training will be conducted at least twice on normal duties, usually more depending on your station)  - Respond to different types of calls (rescue, suicide, traffic accidents, fires, false alarms, fire alarms, various types of spillages, hazardous materials)  - Hold and perform secondary appointments, which are basically administrative tasks (includes things like logistics, fire safety enforcement, operational survey for familiarization of premises, planning and coordination high-risk installations exercises a.k.a HRIs, hydrant checks, manpower management, NSF management, community engagement, and other ad-hoc duties as required)  As a section commander, you are also expected to lead sections and, sometimes the entire rota when you are assigned as the ground commander for exercises. Therefore, other than the foundation rescue and firefighting skills that even firefighters (CPLs and below) are trained in, you need to be able to visualize exercises as they are ongoing, be able to perform proper communication with other sections during exercises, plan out what needs to be done and be familiar with how to tackle different situations during rescue and firefighting. Because you never know when you need these skills, you need to have them at your fingertips at all times.  Your actual workload will depend on what appointments you get, how balanced the appointment distribution is in your rota, and how on your station is. Certain appointments, such as enforcement, operational survey and leave management tend to take up more time. If your commander is very on, then obviously all the regulars will hold more appointments.  Generally, you can expect to do more administrative tasks than seeing real action.  Edit: I recommend you to do at least a few months of research before cementing your decision.

SAF tends to act stupid at times so you need to keep reinforcing the fact that you had booked the ticket BEFORE you received the SAF100 and therefore either they defer you or compensate you in full for the ticket.  I applied for deferment once before due to exams.  As I said, SAF tends to act stupid at times.  Kena reject 'cos they said the SAF100 was sent out 6 months in advance so I had plenty of time to plan my schedule.  I wrote back to say that I am NOT the one who decides when the exams are.  Its the school.  And the school is NOT going to change their schedule just because of one big fark NSman.  Kena reject again.  Same retarded reason given.  I wrote back AGAIN to say that even if you gave me 6 years notice, let alone 6 months, also no use.  The school sets the exam date not me and the school's schedule does not revolve around me.  How do you expect the school to cater to every student's schedule?  Ended by threatening to go to my MP who was at that the time defence minister.  They finally approved it but typical SAF, must have the last word, and again they said \"next time plan your time properly as we gave you 6 month notice\".  I replied back saying thanks for the deferment but again I say, even you give me 6 years notice also no use because the SCHOOL plans the exam dates and not me and the school cannot possibly cater to every student's schedule.  So yes, as long as you have a genuine case, you need to persevere.  SAF will try to act stupid and pretend they don't get it and simply reject.

During SIT test,whenever it was his turn to lead,he would often scold the person who screws(not purposely) up his plan.For the majority of his BMT,he would be all smiles and chatty around his officers but he kept his distance from the rest of his platoon/section and only bothered with them when it was his turn/or he volunteer to lead.(eg at field camp as platoon leader)  Needless to say,he was ranked as one of the lowest when it came to peer appraisal.He did not want to loose his chance to become an officer so as a last resort,he signed on in order to secure a place since he has no problems with his IPPT.  Think carefully as to whether you actually have the ability and desire to lead and not because you romanticize the idea of being the alpha wolf in the pack.", "name": "uselessbum"}, {"date": "17-11-2010, 09:19 PM", "text": "you just entered army?", "name": "anime_toys08"}, {"date": "17-11-2010, 09:24 PM", "text": "In order of what you typed...

The detergent powder bring about half a packet is more than enough, see how many times you want to do your laundry, because you can always put under the fan and wear it again the next day. They will train you till you pass, no worries.  2 & 3) I'm not definitely sure about how's life in PTP as I was from the Enhanced Batch (it was so packed and rushed that I'm satisfied with 30 minutes of admin time alr ), but I heard from my PTP friends that most of their time they will do a lot of physical training and condition, and it will be progressive. But one thing I can tell you is that you will have a lot of time for major high keys in once you reached your high key events like field camp urban ops etc due to your period being stretched over 4 months.  4) It really depends, because they will have NAVY, ARMY, RSAF recruitment talk during your time in BMT and you can express interest etc. Where you go will depends whether you meet the requirements or not lor.

As for non-combat fit or service personnels, those with the desire to serve for a different position like Logistics Asst to Logistic Spec, can be done if you talked to your direct head, S4. The S4 would then talk to S1 to send you for course at Army Logistic Base; for Admin Asst >>> Admin Spec / Admin Supervisor, you need go School of Manpower for 12 day course.

None of my peers, other than PS and encik, got promoted.  During my 5th ICT year, they sent me another letter of promotion for my fifth arrow. I was really WTF at that time since I am not a KAH, never attended PS course nor was I outstanding and I am a C9 downgrader.

Not exactly is ghost, just spooky encounter.  During my 2 weeks confinement, i went bathing at 9.30pm. When i enter the toilet, i saw my friend at the basin washing clothes. I move on to the bathing cubicles, where i see one of which is already occupied. So i took the cubicles next to it and i started bathing.  As i bath, i noticed a metal frame spectacles on the L-shaped space where you'll normally place your shampoo lah or such. (Our 1st 2 weeks a lot of people blur blur bring metal frame specs in, so it's normal) Didn't think so much cos i already know that it's already occupied next door.  Then as i finished, i wiped myself dry and is about to move out of the cubicles, i turned around and still see the spec there. Didn't care much, i moved out of the cubicle.  Have a feeling that could it be someone left it there, like forgotten to take his spec? I turned back and see that 'occupied' cubicle, hey, the door thingy is green and it's not occupied. I pushed open the door and went in, the spec is not there.  Feeling puzzled, i asked my friend, who is still outside washing his clothes.  \"Eh, that cubicle de spec is yours de ah?\"  \"No leh, mine's here\"  \"Hmm? Then just now got people come in take spec or not?\"  \"No?\" He replied.  Feeling a bit odd liao, i asked him, \"Just now i go in, got anyone just bathed and came out?\"  He said, \"No?

Every Coy building is a L shape design & there are 3 trees at the start, centre & end of building. Every coy (Coy A) is 2nd floor is PL 1, 3rd floor is PL 2, 4th floor is PL 3 (this mean Coy b will be 2nd floor is PL 4, 3rd floor is PL 5, 4th floor is PL 6).   But Coy C in the whole unit has only 2 tree which is at the start & end but centre do not have tree & also our Coy C is the only coy in the whole unit to have 2nd floor is PL 9, 3rd floor is PL 8, 4th floor is PL 7.   This is what I hear.   Long time ago, PL 9 is at 4th floor & the PL I/C jump down @ 0000hrs but did not land at the ground because he is hang at the tree which is located in the centre of our Coy building.   Everything have settle on the next day but no matter how they clean the blood on the tree, it is always there, so they just don't care about it.   At that very night just 1 night before PL I/C jump off @ 0000hrs, alot of PL mates saw the PL I/C jump & hang at the tree with blood coming out. This happen every night & the unit have to do something about it.   They call the priest & he advice to remove the tree because PL I/C is hang there & spirit cannot go any where & that why the blood are unable to remove from the tree & there is a need to remove the tree.   On top of that, the PL I/C know the way back to PL, so instead of PL 9 at 4th floor, they should change to 2nd floor & replace PL 7 from 2nd floor to 4th floor. So that when he come back to his PL but cannot find his PL mates, he will left Coy C & go to the place he should be.   End of 1st story & start of 2nd story.     I have a PL I/C who is fit & always a clown. He always kena puinsh for being a clown by SGTs but he is fit to do all the puinshment. The SGTs all know that he is just entertaining all of us, so the SGTs are not angry when he is trying to be funny. But we do know that even clown, there are time for serious matter.   My PL I/C did not dare to sleep on his bed & always sleep on the floor beside his bubby.   This is because near to every night, someone will shake him him & ask him to fall in but when he open his eyes, he saw or hear nothing. As time go by, this always happen & he don't care about it but this time together the locker shake & banging sound. He open his eye but he saw or hear nothing.   My PL I/C is from Sect 3 & happen that the PL I/C who jump is from Sect 3 too which we find out from 1 of our Coy PL SGT who he is from afew mono intake eariler in 3SIR during his NSF time.

I went to the urinal and started to pee. As I was finishing, I suddenly realised that every single tap, including the showers and basins were running. I freaked out, finished my pee and rushed back to my bunk.  I never went to toilet in the wee hrs of the night again. If you know the Nee Soon Camp toilets, the taps are push taps. And the toilet was empty when I went in, so go figure. From what I heard, a few years before my batch, there was a recruit from C Coy that committed suicide by jumping off the building from the 3rd fl. Ever since then, there has been weird happenings.     This happened to my fellow instructor in Feb 2000. I was a Recce instructor in SMI. And we used to bring our trainees to Tekong to train regularly. My fellow instructor, B, followed one such batch to Tekong. One night, he followed a 4 man team during their recce mission.  The team decided to habour near the Fibuar village. Where the team commander, another team mate and my instructor were in the vegetation in the middle of a Y junction. And the other two were opp in the bushes along the axis. It was in the wee hrs of the morning when B heard the two across the road shouting out to him. He told them to shut up and watch for enemy movement. But the two persisted and he went over to check on them.  B shone a torchlight on their faces and asked them what they were shouting about. Their faces were apparently pale white with fear. The two trainees asked if B saw the white figure crossing the road towards his original position. KNN! B turned back and called the whole team back on the axis.  To cut a long story short, the team had their exercise cut short. And the two who saw the figure had to be counseled.

Since I am young, I am a \"Ghost Fans\" of Russell Lee, SFOGS & others. I always wanted to see a \"REAL GHOST\"!! But I don't have any \"LUCK\" on it. I always thought I can sense or saw them. But the answer is \"NO\"!! Cause \"GHOST\" isn't that \"EASY\" to be \"SEEN\". My \"DREAM OF SEEING GHOST\" come true, is only when I get enlist to NS. I know a lot of ghost story about NS at Pulau Txxxxg, Yxxxn Camp & others. Some may think is just to scare guys who are going NS or bull****ting!! Friendly speaking I also thought of that before.  Okay!! Let stop all the \"OPENING\"!! Is time to \"START\", \"MY OWN GHOSTLY ENCOUNTER DURING NS LIFE\". Let\u2019s start the story on the day I enlist to Pulau Txxxxg(Army). The story I call it Miss White Of Pulau Txxxxg. It is a \"SPECIAL DAY\" to me & others. It is the day that I enlist to the \"WELL KNOW TRAINING CAMP\", \"PULAU TXXXXG\"!! It is a place that train \"BOY\" to \"MAN\" but is also a place \"FULL OF SPOOKY STORY\".  The enlistment day have come!! Just like every guy, check in at the Pasir Ris Interchange for bus to Changi Ferry Terminal than waiting for ferry to Pulau Txxxxg & so on. Everything seen \"FINE\". But is it really \"FINE\"?? Cause during booking in our bunk, I notice there is a piece of \"LONG HAIR\" which is belong to girl that is lying on my bed. In my mind, I thought maybe is belong to the auntie that change our bedsheet so I don't bother that much. By the way, my company is locate near the Pulau Txxxxg Ferry Terminal. Whereby alot of \u201cSPOOKY ENCOUNTER\u201d have been spread at there.  The day & night at the island is totally different. Day is as \"HOT LIKE OVEN\" & Night is as \"FREEZE LIKE FRIGDE\".  Second day at the well know island, wake up for 5BX, breakfast & so on. After the training, go back to my bunk to take bathing stuff. Arrive at the bunk & turn on the light, I am shock. Cause I see the same old \"LONG HAIR\" lying on my bed again. Act like nothing happen, I walk to it, pick up & throw away. So on for the day. You guys must be thinking why I never tell anyone?? Cause they will just scold me to stop the crap.  Third day still the same until the day when we are preparing our outfield item. It is around 11plus, we still packing the item for outfield. Everyone is busy packing. While I am packing my stuff, I notice someone in White Pass by my bunk window at the corridor. So I ask my buddy is it just now Platoon Commander or Platoon Sergeant passes by our bunk?? My buddy told me \"NO\"!! Why I think of them. Cause they always wear \u201cWHITE POLO T-SHIRT\u201d. So out of curious, I go out the bunk & see who is that??  I am shock to find out that, there is no one outside the corridor & staircase. So to my first thought, is it really I see something that I always want to see when I am young. Truly speaking, I never thought is a \"GHOST\" in the first place. Cause the way it show just like a normal human being.  After the incident, I start to have \"HIGH FEVER\" last for 3days. It is \"TRUE ENOUGH\" that story about seeing \"GHOST\" at the island will make you fall sick. On my book out day, I meet up my buddies who have accompanied me on the first day of enlistment. Meet up with him & I tell him what have happen to me during the training day at the island. He tells me on that day, he want to tell me something regarding about my company & platoon. But he is afraid later will affect me, during the stay at there. He say that there are rumour of my company about seeing \u201cLONG HAIR\u201d on the bed, \u201cWHITE LADY\u201d passing by the corridor from level 4 to 5 & \u201cLOUD KNOCKING\u201d sound from cabinet & door.  After hearing everything he tell me, I \u201cCURSE & SWEAR\u201d on him. Cause he now than tell me all this \u201cGOOD STUFF\u201d!! Really is my so call \u201cBUDDY\u201d!! But never mind \u201cEVERYTHING IS OVER\u201d!! By the way, it is not what you \u201cSEE\u201d make you \u201cSCARE\u201d!! Is after the incident you recall the \u201cIMAGINE\u201d of the \u201cINCIDENT\u201d make you \u201cTERRIFY\u201d!! Believe anot?? I \u201cBELIEVE\u201d!!  Okay!!

Though no ghostly encounters, we encountered quite a number of weird things. First, one of my platoon mates dislocated his shoulder while we were having a basketball game. Then another fell down and injured his back while we were having our IPPT test. This is not the end. A third platoon mate injured his ankle while we were playing soccer at the field and a forth person scalded his hands while he was preparing his cup noodles. The second and third guys went long MCs. Luckily they never went OOC.  All the above happened within a week. Sensing something not very right, our platoon IC sought approval from our PC to give some offerings by burning some incense papers. Our PC gave his go-ahead but on the condition that everything to be done as low profile as possible.  After that, everything went smoothly.  Another interesting thing happened while I was in Nee Soon Camp which not everyone will encounter one   That night, we were having an exercise when one of the SSGT KI DANG (\u8d77\u4e69). Really KI DANG okay not KI SIAO. It was an interesting sight. The OC has to call off the exercise and several of us helped to take off the FBO and Rifle the SSGT is holding.

It was very dark and fortunately, I managed to see light coming from one direction (the light is from the lamp where commander light). I quickly walked back by following the light. I finally managed to find my shell scrape and found my rifle inside it. I never had any sleepwalking experience before.  2)  I was in Griffin company under PS Soh Meng Wee (that guy is an ass seriously). My friend and I would stay up to talk until late, and I will always look at the windows just in case PS Soh comes up to patrol. There is one window, followed by a small wall, followed by another window. Everytime, I will see someone walking past the first window. I will alert my friend. But every time strangely, the person will fail to appear in the second window. The strangest thing is that on the night before POP, my PS asked us whether we got see something like that.  3) I was then posted to 3rd guards 11th Mono under LTC Tay Boon Kiat. The 3 consecutive dark Wednesday. In 2004, one month after the hungry ghost festival, there was three death consecutively in my unit. The first was the dunking incident by commando on guards. The second was a guy who was killed in motor incident. The third was an Indian sergeant who died after clearing his pre-ranger course selection. Rumors that my camp did not pray during hungry ghost festival.  4) 3Sir noisy tree. We were made to patrol 3SIR camp although most of them moved out. One night while patrolling, we encountered noise coming out from the tree. I did not take notice until after ORD, I talked to a guy who ORDed from 3Sir.
