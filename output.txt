First deliveries are expected in about 18 months.Contenders for the contract remain unclear, but sources told Jane's that talks on the programme are under way with the US. This suggests that potential candidates include the 227 mm Multiple Launch Rocket System and the High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System, both from Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control.The IFV programme is aimed to equip three battalions, with initial deliveries expected around the end of 2008. The locally developed Singapore Technologies (ST) Kinetics 8 x 8 Terrex AV81 IFV is among several platforms under consideration; other options remain unknown.The army most recently upgraded its artillery with the introduction of ST Kinetics' Pegasus 155 mm/39 calibre Singapore Lightweight Howitzer, unveiled in late 2005. This supplemented the ST Kinetics Primus 155 mm/39 calibre self-propelled artillery system that was revealed two years earlier.The wheeled IFV would complement two tracked platforms in current service: the ST Kinetics Bionix IFV, operationally deployed since 1999; and the older Giat Industries AMX-10P infantry combat vehicle.The Singapore Army will further bolster its capabilities with deliveries, due to start in mid-2008, of 66 ex-German Armed Forces Krauss-Maffei Wegmann Leopard 2A4 main battle tanks, together with an additional 30 platforms earmarked as spares. These are intended to replace AMX-13 light tanks.The planned acquisitions are linked to a broader force modernisation programme currently in progress and dubbed the third-generation Singapore Armed Forces.

The High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) is the newest member of the Multiple Launch Rocket System family. It is a highly mobile artillery rocket system that offers MLRS firepower on a wheeled vehicle, making it an ideal system for the medium-weight brigades under the new Army Vision. The HIMARS launcher, a wheeled vehicle, is lighter in weight compared to the MLRS M-270 launcher. It weighs approximately 15 tons, compared to 27 tons for the M-270.The HIMARS TD will provide a lightweight, C\u0096130 transportable version of the M\u0096270 multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) launcher.Mounted on a 5\u0096ton family of medium tactical vehicles (FMTV) truck chassis, it will fire any rocket or missile in the MLRS family of munitions [MFOM]. The HIMARS launchers will some commonality with its older and heavier tracked cousins, the M270 and M270A1 launcher systems. The HIMARS design concept will include the familiar launcher module, fire control, and digital command and control systems, and a self-reload capability. The HIMARS uses the same command, control, and communications, as well as the same crew, as the MLRS launcher but carries only one rocket or missile pod. It will roll on and off a C\u0096130 transport aircraft and, when carried with a combat load, will be ready to operate within 15 minutes of landing. The HIMARS will fire either six MLRS rockets or one Army Tactical Missile. Because of the lighter weight of using one pod rather than two, it will have a faster time, compared to the current M270, from the point the fire mission is received to the actual munition firing.HIMARS is based on the need for a lighter weight, more deployable MLRS that can be sent anywhere in the world to provide the maneuver commander lethal, long range fires at the very beginning of a conflict. HIMARS is being designed and produced by the Army to support its Early Entry Contingency forces and its Light/Airborne/Air Assault Divisions with long-range, general support rocket and missile indirect fires. Well, what kind of ammo does HIMARS fire?HIMARS is capable of launching the entire MLRS family of munitions, including the Extended-Range Rocket, the Reduced Range Practice Rocket and all future variants. HIMARS carries a single six-pack of MLRS rockets, or one Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missile.1. The Extended-Range MLRS Rocket (ER-MLRS) improves the basic M26 range of 32km to more than 45km and the area of influence by 107%.2. In April 2004, HIMARS successfully test fired the new extended range guided rocket GMLRS, with a range of more than 70km.3. HIMARS is also capable of firing the long-range ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) guided missile. The ATACMS family includes the Block 1, Block 1A and Block 1A Unitary missiles. The Block 1 missile delivers 950 anti-personnel anti-material (AP/AM) baseball-sized M74 submunitions to ranges exceeding 165km.4. The Block 1A missile range exceeds 300km by reducing the submunition payload to 300 bomblets and adding GPS guidance. In November 2004, HIMARS successfully completed Initial Operational Test & Evaluation, and in June 2005 it entered US Army service with the 18th Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, NC.

Arty boys really got something to cheer about.Something interesting here \u0085..\u0093 \u0085..The American GMLRS (officially the \"GMLRS Unitary rocket\") rockets has been a great success. In the last year, U.S. Army artillery units in Iraq have been firing about ten GPS guided 227mm MLRS rockets a month. When the GMLRS (Guided MLRS) first went into action, the troops realized that this was a near-perfect artillery weapon. There have been no reliability problems with the GMLRS, which has a range of 70 kilometers and, because of the GPS guidance has the same accuracy at any range. Unguided rockets become less accurate the farther they go. The GMLRS is designed to put each rocket within a 16 foot circle (the center of which is the GPS coordinates the rocket is programmed to go for). In nearly all cases, the GMLRS rocket appears to land less than ten feet from the aiming point. What makes the GMLRS most useful is not just its accuracy, which is about the same as air force JDAM GPS guided smart bombs, but because the 200 pound GMLRS warhead produces a smaller bang than the smallest JDAM (500 pounds). When it comes to urban fighting, smaller is better. Less collateral damage, and your troops can be closer to the target when the explosion occurs. In Iraq, the 200 pound GMLRS warhead is just the right size for your average Iraqi building. The structure, and the bad guys within, are destroyed, and adjacent structures suffer minimal, or no, damage. For that reason, even some Iraqi politicians have come out in praise of the GMLRS. In Afghanistan, most of the fighting is outside urban areas, but even there, in many cases the bad guys are in one building of a compound, while innocent civilians are in another. In such cases, the GMLRS could take out one building, without destroying the other.  In order to get more GMLRS rockets, all new MLRS rocket production is being switched to GMLRS, and a retrofit kit, that will turn unguided MLRS rockets into GMLRS, has been introduced. The army believes that GMLRS will remain the most useful smart weapon, even with the coming introduction of the hundred pound 155mm GPS guided Excalibur artillery shell, and the U.S. Air Forces 250 pound JDAM (the SDB, or small diameter bomb). Both of these weapons pack a smaller punch than the GMLRS, and that may be a drawback in some situations. Ground troops are certain that the GMLRS warhead is just right, at least in most cases. \u0085\u0085.\u0094http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htart/art...s/20070308.aspxVIDEO CLIPS ON GMLRShttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM2vW4_PxEohttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AHU6F6oEoohttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpdfgUKWzyshttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rqduj8dDUI This post has been edited by Callsign 24 Seira on Aug 9 2007, 09:39 AM", "name": "Callsign 24 Seira"}, {"date": "Aug 9 2007, 10:57 AM", "text": "Yes it did.

GourleyOne concrete example that highlights the contribution of precision fires in today\u0092s tactical environments can be found in the expanding combat application of the guided multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) unitary munition. The guided MLRS unitary is an outgrowth of the XM30 guided MLRS rocket that was developed under an international partnership of the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, France and Germany. With a range in excess of 70 kilometers, the GMLRS system incorporates a GPS-aided inertial guidance package integrated on a product-improved rocket body. Small canards on the guided rocket nose provide basic maneuverability and enhance the accuracy of the system, which is capable of delivering several hundred dual purpose improved conventional munition (DPICM) bomblets.In June 2003, Lockheed Martin received its first GMLRS low rate initial production (LRIP-1) contract, with the final rockets delivered under LRIP-1 in May 2005. (Additional GMLRS LRIP contracts followed LRIP-1).In an urban/counterinsurgency setting that places increasing importance on minimizing collateral damage, planners saw the need to replace the hundreds of DPICM bomblets with a single 196-pound unitary warhead, giving battlefield commanders the ability to attack targets up to 70 kilometers away with a precise high precision blast.Thus in 2002, Lockheed Martin conducted a system demonstration of a quick reaction GMLRS unitary rocket, together with a nine-month component advanced development program.In October 2003, Lockheed Martin received a $119 million contract to conduct system development and demonstration (SDD) for a guided MLRS variant with a single warhead. Representing a spiral-development to expand the MLRS family of munitions, the guided MLRS unitary was seen as the optimum solution to expand the current target set of GMLRS, giving a maneuver commander a precision capability while greatly limiting collateral damage in restrictive terrain and urban areas.The guided MLRS unitary SDD contract included 86 rockets, 71 of which are flight articles, with the balance supporting test and other activities. The program will continue through 2007. But America\u0092s warfighters could not wait for that program\u0092s evolution.\u0093In January 2005 an urgent need statement (UNS) request was approved at the Department of the Army for a precision-guided munition with limited collateral damage,\u0094 said Rick Vallario, director of Business Development for Tactical Missiles at Lockheed Martin.\u0093At the time, we were in the SDD phase for guided MLRS unitary,\u0094 he continued. \u0093The Army came to us and asked, \u0091Can we do some follow-on tests of the current variant that you\u0092re using, get a limited safety release and get a number produced and sent to theater?\u0092 So, last year we went ahead and in May 2005 we delivered the first 72 to the government. By the end of that year we had produced approximately 486 that were sent to theater.\u0094In August 2005, Lockheed Martin announced that fire units of Battery Bravo, 3rd Battalion, 13th Artillery Regiment, had recently conducted the first in-theater tests of the new rockets in Iraq. According to the announcement, \u0093Seven GMLRS unitary rockets were rippled fired from a 65-kilometer distance and reached the target with extreme accuracy. Test objectives included demonstrating the GMLRS unitary rocket precision capability and also demonstrated its lethality while limiting collateral damage. The tests served as a determination of employability of the GMLRS rocket in the global war on terrorism.\u0094The new systems soon saw combat employment in theater. The capabilities of the new system led to a second urgency of need statement, at the beginning of 2006, for approximately 500 additional guided MLRS unitary rockets.According to Vallario, the first 28 pods of these rockets (six rockets per pod) were delivered to the Army in September 2006, with the remainder of the rockets covered under the second UNS, to be delivered throughout the rest of the year.Vallario clarified that the guided MLRS unitary rockets now being delivered to the military are not the same as the objective configuration that will emerge from the XM31 SDD program.As an example, he pointed to the fact that the Phase I rockets now being fielded have a dual-mode fuze option of either point-detonating or delay. In contrast, the Phase II objective XM31 rockets that will emerge from SDD will feature a tri-mode fuze, with point-detonating, delay and airburst options. In addition, the objective design will incorporate certain insensitive munitions (IM) upgrades to provide the soldier added safety in hostile environments.\u0093The system that\u0092s over there right now is just called guided MLRS unitary,\u0094 he added. \u0093The objective system is called XM31.\u0094In parallel with the urgent need deliveries and SDD testing, Lockheed Martin is also working with industry partners Aerojet and MBDA to develop and test a new enhanced blast warhead (EBW) design for the guided MLRS unitary munition.Following industry-funded flight testing of the EBW earlier this year, Al Duchesne, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control\u0092s director of MLRS Rocket Programs noted, \u0093Because of its over-pressurization design, the enhanced blast warhead variant of the GMLRS unitary will devastate enclosed structures with minimum collateral damage. GMLRS unitary has quickly been established as the weapon of choice for deep-strike precision fire in urban and mountainous environments.\u0094Vallario added, \u0093The enhanced blast warhead is an increased capability over the one we are currently developing. What we\u0092re doing now is adding more capabilities. The objective, or the XM31 warhead, is designed and developed to do a specific mission in a requirements document, but the enhanced blast warhead gives you additional capabilities.\u0094In terms of the significance of the guided MLRS unitary munition to today\u0092s warfighter, he summarized, \u0093First, it\u0092s a combat multiplier. It\u0092s a combat proven system used by joint forces\u0097even though the Army owns it, the Marine Corps is using it. And it\u0092s a system being used where precision, accuracy, lethality and responsiveness are critical for accomplishment of missions within the global war on terrorism.\u0094Link", "name": "LazerLordz"}, {"date": "Sep 13 2007, 11:30 PM", "text": "It's official: S'pore to buy US rocket artillery system ... ahem... for SG tax payers, 13.9.2007 11.12pm   This post has been edited by diCam on Sep 13 2007, 11:36 PM", "name": "diCam"}, {"date": "Sep 14 2007, 02:45 AM", "text": "M142 HIMARS itself describes a system with 1 missile pod mounted on a 5 tons  6x6 truck.So when one talk abt HIMARS, it includes the truck as well.The 9 trucks could be meant to be Resupply Vehicles(RSVs) that could carry 2 missile pods.From this link and I quote:Or maybe we are buying 9 standard HIMARS and 9 HIMARS missile pods plus all the FCS, communication system etc, so that we could intergrated the other 9 onto a tracked chasis?BX based MLRS anyone?

It carries a single 6-pack of rockets or one ATACMS missile mounted on a FMTV five-ton truck.The HIMAS retains some of the characteristics of the proven M270 MLRS, while providing outstanding transportability and superior mobility over the MLRS. It retains self-loading and autonomous features as well as rockets and missiles launched from the M270 MLRS artillery system. A wheeled chassis means high mobility and less costs of ownership.On January 3, 2005, Lockheed-Martin received the third follow-on low rate initial procurement (LRIP) contract valued at $109 million. Under the terms of the contract the US Army will buy 37 HIMARS launchers and the US Marine Corps one launcher.The launcher saw combat for the first time during operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. The US Army and the USMC want to procure up to 900 HIMARS systems all together beginning in 2005. In June 2005, the US Army's 3rd Battalion, 27th Field Artillery, XVIII Airborne Corps, at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, became the first HIMARS-equipped unit.===================================================================================Related HIMARS deployment links..http://sill-www.army.mil/famag/2005/NOV_DE...PAGES_14_19.pdfhttp://www.missilesandfirecontrol.com/our_...ct-HIMARS.shtmlhttp://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m270.htmhttp://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/do...p_20/sld003.htm This post has been edited by Callsign 24 Seira on Sep 20 2007, 02:09 AM", "name": "Callsign 24 Seira"}, {"date": "Sep 16 2007, 06:42 PM", "text": "Some Malaysian bloggers' comments about HIMARs and their frustration at the level of maintanence that their MAF is giving their own equipment..Link", "name": "LazerLordz"}, {"date": "Sep 16 2007, 10:38 PM", "text": "Majority of the posts were extremely bias!", "name": "diCam"}, {"date": "Sep 17 2007, 08:49 AM", "text": "been thinking whether the GPS guided rockets purchase is an indication of northland possessing similar munitions.", "name": "kanzer"}, {"date": "Sep 17 2007, 05:38 PM", "text": "Wow...

The missile flew the planned trajectory and hit the target, which was at a range of 75 km.This was the second Follow-on Production Test of the new ATACMS Unitary configuration that allows Warfighters to use the missile in a vertical attack trajectory, an essential new capability for urban environments where low collateral damage is desired. It also was the first firing of an ATACMS munition from a HIMARS launcher equipped with a UFCS.The UFCS is an evolutionary block upgrade and technology refresh of the MLRS Fire Control System. UFCS recently completed its Development and Qualification Program, and is now being delivered under the HIMARS full-rate production program.\"ATACMS is the weapon of choice against time-sensitive and pre-planned targets for U.S. Forces in the Global War on Terror,\" said Jim Gribschaw, director of Precision Fires at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control. \"The successful flight test of this ATACMS Unitary configuration further validates that the system will continue to be an asset to our Warfighters in the future. The incredible precision engagement capability of ATACMS allows commanders engage a target with little or no collateral damage.\"This flight test provided a wealth of technical data to support the quality of the ATACMS improved Unitary configuration production. It also demonstrated the missile-to-launcher interface of the new UFCS, missile performance and accuracy from launch to impact, as well as the performance of the whole system software.ATACMS is a long-range guided missile that gives operational commanders the immediate firepower to win the deep battle. Each ATACMS missile is packaged in a MLRS launch pod and is fired from the MLRS Family of Launchers. ATACMS is successfully employed in both urban and non-urban environments.During Operation Desert Storm, ATACMS became the first tactical surface-to-surface missile ever fired in combat by the U.S. Army. ATACMS is a combat-proven evolutionary family of missiles that also scored numerous successes again in Operation Iraqi Freedom, during which 456 missiles were fired.Link", "name": "LazerLordz"}, {"date": "Apr 19 2008, 06:34 PM", "text": "There's an interesting update on the MLRS rockets.

I read it, I hope correctly, as meaning it is good for those militaries outside of the big boys club that don't have the money for tracked platforms and the ancillary log lift elements that go with it.Which is why I commented that these 2nd tier militaries will be suffering from delusions of grandeur if they try to behave like the big boys and talk about air lifting strategic assets like an MLRS system.  They simply don't have the asset base to even dream of doing it on a meaningful scale.YF ... your comment on GMLRS and Malaysia is trying to narrow the idea of a C130 deployable MLRS from one of broad utility to one of narrower (or niche) utility.  Nothing wrong with that ... there is always a niche for every product but it isn't the same argument as before.Nonetheless, to try and adapt your argument to the original premise of 2nd tier militaries ...GMLRS ... how many players in the market can have access to the GPS component in GMLRS?  Without GPS guidance, the Inertial guidance unit is accurate to only tube arty equivalency (M31 clocked 150m CEP at 49km using IMU only).  Might as well use tube arty in that case.  If they do have access to GPS, might as well go for Excalibur.  That will give you the option of applying precision damage in 10kg HE increments rather than the 80kg of HE or nothing option with Unitary GMLRS.East/West Malaysia - how many countries out there have the unique geographical layout of Malaysia?  Mostly Archipelagic states?  Wouldn't these countries be better off investing in high speed sealift assets to move their platforms?  East-West Malaysia can be done in just over a day on a high speed transport.  Seriously, if 24 hours is going to make that critical a difference, then I'd suggest they are in deeper \"soft brown stuff\" than can be solved by having a battery of MLRS delivered air express.Also, while a single ship can lift a battery of arty plus spare, the same can't be said about C130s.  One would require more than 30 C-130s to lift a battery of MLRS including supporting equipment (I'm making a wild guess).  If one, like TUDM, does not have enough C130s then how many waves of C130s would be required?  Would the total hours, including turnaround, equal that of the sealift?    There is nothing wrong with the idea of a wheeled MLRS platform.  It's just that I don't think C130 portability is one of the main ideas behind it.  This whole C130 portable system thing seems to be suffering from overhyped marketing drive ... it's becoming a lable tacked onto any mil equipment that fits the cargo bay of a C130, regardless of the utility of such capabilites.What I can think of as a strong advantage for a wheeled vs tracked platform is that wheeled platforms suffer from lower operational attrition than tracked platform.

C-130 transportability isn't marketing hype from the US POV, they really are developing TTPs for HIMARS which sees that feature being used. In the US, they see HIMARS as first entry forces, providing capability until the M270 arrives, thus releasing the HIMARS for redeployment elsewhere.Of course, with other countries, how useful the air tranportability feature is will have to be examined on a case-by-case basis. Personally, I've always been on the skeptical side with regards to air transportable mechanised units, which is why I've never been particularly enamoured with FCS's C-130 requirement.But I do think that with the HIMARS, it does provide a good deal of versatility that should not be overlooked easily. Each HIMARS launcher comes with 2 ammo truck/trailers in US Army usage. So that'll be 3 C-130 flights/launcher. Estimate it'll take what, 20-25 C-130 flights to lift a battery of 6 launchers and associated reloaders? But the difference is, with just 3-4 flights, one can have 3 HIMARS launchers, ready to carry out fire missions at targets within 70kms (or within 300kms with a ATACMs Blk 1A) within literally minutes after landing.

Very likelyA truck chassis carrying one 6-shot pod instead of two, topping the scales at 10 tonnes is a design with weight reduction in mind.  Was this the prime and only design objective?That's a big NO, A400M transportable ( see, I 'm sensitive to your peeve about Charlie-can-fly pitches ) is a good advantage. I see it as a major improvement over the M270s but not the only selling point, although I didn't put up other gains.A weight reduction in having a lighter truck chassis and one pod of 6 shots topping at 10 tonnes won't be done just to make HIMARS medlift friendly ( although for the Brit LIMAWS - lift is a prime consideration)Getting a lighter nippier system and burning less JP8 and saving the earth by eating less resources are wonderful benefits too, but exclusively - I don't think so.Good point on those who don't have access to precision guidance - what they should do is not buy HIMARS.

The Real World \u0099 unfortunately does exist ...Secondly, I just want to clarify a usage of terms.MLRS - while many take the term to be synonymous with the US M270, it is also actually a generic term to refer to any modern MRL (Multiple Rocket Launchers) with systemised load/reloads.  A MLRS system, like the TDM Astros, is a rather imprecise tool and as such is very much a strategic support asset ... not much use in any thing other than a full-on conventional fight ... and then only to obliterate grid squares rather than to take out point targets.GMLRS - likewise, is also a generic term to refer to any MLRS system with GPS (or GLOSNASS, Galileo, COMPASS, etc) guided capabilities.  This change turns a rather imprecise area suppression tool into a PGM tool with greater applicability in other operations besides conventional warCourse Corrected MLRS - I will lump any other form of accuracy improvement means, such as Inertial Guidance, into MLRS as opposed to GMLRS.  The CEP for CC-MLRS is just not in the same league as GPS-MLRS.  As I've quoted before, M31 achieved 150m CEP at 49km using Inertial Guidance only as opposed to a 5m CEP using CEP+Inertial.  The former puts it closer to tube artillery specs rather than PGM specs.HIMARS - specifically refers to the M142 MLRS, a wheeled adaptation of the MLRS system on the M270.  It may or may not come with GPS guided munitions.Sorry for the late clarification but I've only just realised that this may be the root cause of our disagreement.On with the rest of the post then ...Yes, I've agreed that for the US Army, and the handful of other top tier militaries, it is a useful feature ... but further down the ladder? Take a non-military commercial example, the Alfa Romeo 147 (2.0) Selespeed.  It boast of incorporating F1 technology into a road car, namely it's Selespeed paddle shift gearbox.  Now let's make this clear, I have no problems with paddle shifters ... in the right platforms they can improve performance and enhance the driving experience.  Filtering down F1 paddle shift gear boxes into supercars,like the Ferrari 360 or a Lambo Gallardo, makes a lot of sense  ... but an Alfa 147 2.0?  FFS, it doesn't even qualify as a hot hatch given it's benchmark 0100kmph figures of 9.3s.Putting such a feature into a rather pedestrian road car is nothing more than pure marketing drivel.  The system (car) just isn't capable of utilising the benefit, let alone maximising it.  Likewise, C130 portability in an MLRS is only really applicable to the US and a select few other Armed Forces.  To all the rest, it's really just marketing hype, their system (armed force) is just not in a position to utilise it.Yes, again the US angle ... and how many armies have 2 layers of MLRS capabilites, a RDF MLRS and Heavy MLRS Follow on Force?This debate is going way way south because we are going off on different tangents with each taking a POV that suits our argument.  I do not disagree with you that this capability is of importance to the US Army or any top tier army with the resources to leverage it.  But what about the other 97% of the other Armed Forces in the world who are on the other side of the bell curve?  As I've said right from the start, I'm talking about these other 180+ countries, 2nd tier and below armed forces.  Any member of this crowd buying into the \"C130 deployable capability\" is seriously in need of a reality check for the reasons I've outlined before - namely;i) lack of airlift capability to begin with.ii) lack of ability to prosecute anything other than a local conflict, thus negating the need to re-deploy a strategic asset inter-theatre.And the TUDM has about 10 C130s.  Assuming full availability and no conflicting tasking it'll take about 24 hours of non-stop sorties to get that lot over.  That's assuming flight time of 3.5 hrs each way, 1 hr at each end to load/unload, refuel and check aircraft.  Same as sealift innit?That's assuming no conflicting tasking.  But the TDM will realistically have other tasks for the C130 it has ... so many things to do, so little assets to do it with.Not meaning to deride your post or any disrespect to you ... but I always love it when people start pushing the long strike range of a weapon without addressing the full targeting cycle that goes with it.Yes, with 4 sorties, you can have 3 GMLRS systems in place.  But when will you be able to get assets in place to provide targeting data for 70-300km strikes?  Once we move away from the US, I'd daresay any other player (in isolation) may find rushing a GMLRS system over in 4 hours to be a non-critical feature.  It will most probably take these non-US armies more than a day or 2 to get some deep recce elements in place to provide viable targetting info.  Malaysia may well be capable of rushing a half-battery of MLRS system over quite quickly but they may well be doing diddly with them for quite a while.

This is an example of an idiosyncratic feature that is key for a select group of customer but quickly becomes meangingless outside of the group.  Same for air transportable MLRS platforms.First point, a nitpick.  HIMARS is basically a wheeled MLRS system.  In itself, it is not strictly a GMLRS platform.  It can salvo off a pod of M26 Free Flight rockets making it same same as other unguided MLRS platforms.  M31 is the option that gives the M142 HIMARS the GMLRS option.So we can agree that these 2nd tier \"small boys\" shouldn't purchase GMLRS since they cannot gurantee access to GPS in a shooting war?  Can we then agree that what they should be buying, the unguided and non-GPS guided MLRS systems, are all pretty much single dimensions weapon systems?

At distances where sealift makes as much sense as Airlift?So even Japan and Korea, the only 1st tier military in the above list, does not have the necessary set of cirumstances to require C130 deployability, despite having the assets.  Even if you were to extend the platform to cheaper wheeled MLRS systems, eg. ASTROS, you will be facing the same constraints I've outlined previously.Yes, air transportability provides flexibility ... that was never in dispute.  Yes it will boil down to capability vs needs.  As I've constantly stressed, the further away you move from the US Army, the more the capability aspect goes downward at an exponential rate ... Which makes it rather an academic exercise for these armies ... which moves it from real capability to marketing only capability.Targetting of non-guided tube artillery is typically based on LOS of a FO on the front line.  This is typically in place, in theatre.Targetting behind the front line will usually be by counter-battery radar or UAV.  The first may be in place but the second, in most armies, is still in a nascent stage and hardly in place or in theatre.  The remaining option for deep targetting will be spec ops troops who will definately need time to get in place.For your above example to work, you will need GPS access, long range targeting ability, LR battle damage assesement ability.  Since you raised Malaysia as your first example, how many of the above boxes can Malaysia tick off?  For that matter, how many countries can tick off the boxes in the above list?  We are now arguing about 2 different things again. 1st tier vs 2nd tier et al.I will stress again, I have never disputed the capabilities of GMLRS and I have no problems with C130 deployability BUT only with the right candidate armed forces.

You seem intent on making the air transports non-usable by whatever means neessary.GMLRS features trajectory shaping allowing for vertical attack.You are not suggesting the JAGSDF is there for invading other people, aren't you? Cos I can't see why they'd be there if they are not there to prevent an invasion, whether the enemy has a practical capability to do so or not.Hokkaido and Okinawa? Why not? Oosumis don't have lots of space, certainly the ability to airlift any HIMARs would be appreciated.I don't understand. If air transportability was never practical for anybody other than the US and a few others, than how would air-transportability provide flexibility? You seem to be contradicting yourself here?With UAVs proliferating, why assume its absence?I agree, the list is short, but not as short as you first made it out to be. And frankly, how many of these 185+ militaries have the capability to buy HIMARS? Only 1st and 2nd tier militaries can.

In Iraq, the M270s fired unguided rockets when the quick salvoes and short time - high saturation of munitions was required, for example as counterfire. It complements  the tube arty ibut does not n any way, took over fire support roles.With that much steel about, I think not having a better CEP ( which is not comparatively very lousy ) is not affecting the situation much.Does it replaces tube arty? Nope, for long periods of saturation fire, tubes are better than the M270s and HIMARsSo, you 're right - the generic unguided MRLS might be a one trick pony.But as that trick works and can work for any army, there's no reason for any armed forces who sees this value and wants the capability - not to buy it.Actually who gets to buy ATACMS and GMLRS depends on the US, you can be the joke of the continent but if it fits US policiies, you can buy the HIMARs or the M270s and all the guided goodies you want.UAE is the 1st customer for HIMARS besides the USMC, The order was - * 20 HIMARS Launchers, mounted on* 20 M1084A1 Family of Medium Truck Vehicles (FMTV);* 104 M26 MLRS Rocket Pods* 130 M30 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) pods* 130 M31 Unitary High Explosive GMLRS Pods* 101 M39A1 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Block 1A * 101 M39A1 ATACMS Block 1A Unitary Rocket PodsAmongst other stuffThe UAE has a total of 6 C-130s to move these 20 trucksBut of course, UAE could have figured these moves around faster and easier on their own wheels than with the sand encrusted tracks of the M270s which are no longer in production but can be had from current uses.

The former role ie supporting army units, is currently serviced only by APC mounted SR-SAMs.If one looks at the frontage of the potential battlefield eg Malay peninsular, this is ~100km from end to end. Technically, coverage at least from medium to high altitudes can be achieved by LR Asters from the Formidables.However, as the side angles of attack down the peninsular reduces the pk, it is preferable to have longer ranged SAMs on the ground in the line of approach. In theory, there doesn't need to be many launchers. Just 2 launchers will already adequately cover the frontage. However if each launcher has to be hooked up to an illuminator, then the cost-effectiveness decreases with the added cost of the illuminator.With a common launcher that has relies on pre-existing guidance, this can be cost-effectively achieved ie just modification and munition cost. No launcher, illuminator, search radar. Logical to explore this option in greater detail.I was actually wondering why SL-AMRAAM was sold to UAE last year without any vehicles attached.

The exercise involved 234 personnel from the Headquarters, Singapore Artillery, Headquarters 3rd Division Artillery and 23rd Battalion, Singapore Artillery as well as the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF). In conjunction with Exercise Daring Warrior, the SAF and the US Army conducted a bilateral air-land integrated live-firing exercise, involving US personnel from the 214th Fires Brigade Headquarters, as well as 1-14th and 2-5th Field Artillery. The two-day bilateral exercise, which ended today, involved the SAF's HIMARS and Apache AH-64Ds helicopters. The US also participated with their HIMARS, F-16 and F-18 fighter aircraft, as well as Ground Liaison and Targeting teams. The Commander of the SAF Training and Doctrine Command Brigadier-General (BG) Lim Hock Yu and the Commanding General of the US Fires Center of Excellence and Fort Sill Major-General (MG) David Halverson were present to witness the exercise. Highlighting the value of Exercise Daring Warrior, BG Lim said, \"Exercise Daring Warrior provides an excellent opportunity for the SAF to maintain the operational capabilities of its HIMARS and to conduct air-land integration training. It also opens up a channel for professional and operational exchanges between the SAF and the US Army.\" Likewise, MG Halverson added that \"the exercise was a great environment for the soldiers to operate in a joint training situation\". In addition, he said, \"As we train together to develop proficiencies and certifications, we are also working to take the training to the next level. We have a great coalition team with the military forces of Singapore.\" Exercise Daring Warrior 2011 is the second HIMARS live-firing exercise conducted since the SAF took delivery of the HIMARS in July 2010. The SAF and the US Army also conducted a joint live-firing exercise during the previous Exercise Daring Warrior, in November 2010. Training in the US enables the SAF to build up its operational capabilities and readiness. It also facilitates sharing of knowledge between the two armed forces. The US' support for the SAF's training in the US reflects the long-standing and excellent defence relationship between the two countries. http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_...02nov11_nr.htmlCoverage provided by USA resources.Fort Sill Operation Daring Warrior 2011 Soldiers from Fort Sill's 1st Battalion, 14th Field Artillery (214th Fires Brigade), train alongside soldiers from the Singaporean Army Nov. 1, 2011.

Rockets from this production lot will be supplied to the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps, and to the armies of Italy, Jordan and Singapore. This contract represents Italy\u0092s first purchase of GMLRS rockets. Deliveries are scheduled to begin in December 2013. The company is currently supplying GMLRS under a $438 million production contract for 767 rockets, awarded in June 2011, that will expire in April 2014.GMLRS is an all-weather, rapidly deployable, long-range rocket that delivers precision strike beyond the range of most conventional weapons. It is designed for destroying targets at ranges up to 70 kilometers. A longer-range GMLRS+ rocket, with a reach of more than 120 kilometers, is being developed and tested by Lockheed Martin using company funds.Each GMLRS rocket is packaged in an MLRS launch pod and is fired from the Lockheed Martin HIMARS or M270 family of launchers.

The French did try an ATGM version with 4 SS-11 missiles mounted on top of the turret. But this was not a best seller and not widely adopted. The best use of the AMX-13 was to use it for what it was bought for, namely as a mobile direct fire platform for support of Infantry regiments. Retiring them was a mistake and leaves the infantry with out armour support. The AMX-13 can go places that a Leo 2 can't and its a lot quieter. Right now, the only conversion that is worth doing on the AMX-13 is to strip out the engine and transmission and use them as pillboxes for coastal defence along the east coast beaches.", "name": "ontheway"}, {"date": "Aug 13 2015, 06:20 PM", "text": "I've got different numbers for the type listed  You can add the new TPQ-53s to the list.
